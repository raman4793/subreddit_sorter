Relegation, the primeval force of terror among all of football, relentlessly looms over these following clubs. But as Sartre implied, could this sense of dread not be the start of a greater push for success?

Can never have enough of those, right?\n\nA draw against Bayern in the opening match of the season was hailed as a success. Hooray, the project was fully underway on its path to glory! What followed were three losses, so now the project was clearly on its death throes. But then, miraculously, they won their next three fixtures against the Bundesliga juggernauts Paderborn, K\u00f6ln, and D\u00fcsseldorf! A modern football fairytale, the Small Village ClubTM Hertha Berlin triumphing against nigh insurmountable odds. Aaaand then they went on a bad spell again. Enough was enough for Berlin\u2019s top dogs, who fired \u010covi\u0107 and did the only sensible thing: hire J\u00fcrgen fucking Klinsmann.\n\nNow, to be fair, during his last time as a manager in the Bundesliga he may not have won a title with Bayern. But isn\u2019t that a remarkable achievement in its own right? Failing where success is set in stone? He defied expectations, subverted them as only Rhian Johnson can. Though in all honesty, it\u2019s not uncommon for Bayern fans to credit him with rebuilding the club internally, modernising it in key aspects like youth development. Bayern almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be where they are today and have been in recent years if it weren\u2019t for Klinsmann.\n\nBack to the present. Klinsmann wanted to transform Berlin into the Big City ClubTM Hertha Berlin. His tenure started well enough, but the team still wasn\u2019t living up to the expectations. To the utter shock and disbelief of everyone, Klinsmann seemed to not be up to the task of coaching a (ambitious) Bundesliga club. California Sunshine was determined to see it through, however, because California Sunshine ain\u2019t no quitter. That is, until 11 February, when he did what any well-adjusted football manager would do and went on Facebook to announce he would step down as Berlin\u2019s manager without previously consulting with anyone in the club beside sugar daddy extraordinaire Lars Windhorst. Although he intended to remain on the supervisory board, he was summarily told to sod off. His time at the striving Big City ClubTM Hertha Berlin was short, but oh so sweet.\n\nKlinsmann\u2019s assistant, Alexander Nouri, took up the mantle of interim manager until the league\u2019s temporary suspension. Out of the four matches he was at the helm, Berlin won once, drew twice, and lost once. Nouri is a friendly, intelligent, and thoughtful person, but his record at his last managerial appointment (Ingolstadt) was zero wins, three draws and five losses, so it shouldn\u2019t have come as a shocking surprise.\n\nFor the third time of the season, Berlin didn\u2019t have the right manager. So during the involuntary pandemic pause, management came together and signed the actual right man for the job: Bruno Labbadia. A mainstay of German football, he\u2019s the one to call when your club is underperforming and in need of a pick-me-up. While Labbadia doesn\u2019t have the best reputation, he is a capable manager who can transform clubs for the better. Whether he can do so in Berlin remains to be seen.\n\nFun fact: It bears repeating that Berlin spent about 76 million \u20ac in the winter transfer period, more than any other club in Europe. They are currently 13th in the league and were defeated by Schalke in the DFB-Pokal.\n\nAnother fun fact, hot off the presses: J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s departure left a void in the supervisory board, and who better to fill that gap than Jens Lehmann. [I\u2019ll just let my good friend Sartre\u2019s musician persona do the talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EG5S8aVCo)\n\n##Who to watch?\n\nPicking a good player out of a group of underperformers is like choosing a spot to be kicked at \u4e00 some are much worse than others, but it\u2019s gonna be bad nonetheless. Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt, Arne Maier, or Javairo Dilrosun have all been much better before and are absolutely huge talents, but aren\u2019t really noteworthy as of right now, sadly. Winter arrival Matheus Cunha has been a ray of hope among the darkness of fighting against the spectre of relegation, despite his Brazilian theatrics.\n\n---\n\n#FC Augsburg\n\n##Short Summary\n\nYou like listening to regular reminders that Augsburg is famous for puppetry. [Current kit.](https://www.soccerboots.de/Data/Images/Big/nike-fc-augsburg-trikot-home-19-20-103-weiss-fcaaj1018-103.png) Apparently, Augsburg doesn\u2019t have a proper mascot and have relied on puppets from the Augsburger Puppenkiste in recent seasons. [If I\u2019m not mistaken, this season it\u2019s this guy.](https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/img/fc-augsburg/crop55248386/4979565888-cv16_9-w940/Copy-20of-20lukas.jpg)\n\n##Playing Style\n\nRun of the mill Bundesliga football. Somewhat competent in pressing, will sometimes show nice passing to move the ball forward.\n\n##Overview\n\nThere\u2019s not a whole lot to Augsburg, is there? Avoiding relegation season after season, they have become something of a regular Bundesliga midtable team, albeit usually in the lower region. They managed a draw against Bayern, I suppose. Other than that, their season has been about as exciting as mayonnaise is spicy.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I initially thought before inspecting their results further. Using modern technology, mathematical analysis has shown that only two of their league matches had a total goal tally of one or less, a 0-0 draw against Wolfsburg and a 1-0 win against Paderborn. In the rest, an average of 3,78 goals were scored. Among them was a spectacular, thrilling 3-5 loss against Dortmund, a match that was Augsburg\u2019s to take after leading 3-1, until Erling Haaland entered the Bundesliga in style.\n\nThey also brought all of us great joy by being eliminated in the first round of the DFB-Pokal by fourth division side SC Verl, in a surprising 1-2 loss. Good times, good times.\n\nLosing all but two matches in 2020 resulted in Augsburg\u2019s upper echelon pulling the plug and firing manager Martin Schmidt during the ongoing pandemic pause. His replacement will be Heiko Herrlich, and if his rough tenure at Leverkusen is anything to go by, you should prepare for more roughness.\n\n##Who to watch?\n\nRuben Vargas is a competent winger who will sooner than later play for a bigger club.\n\n---\n\n#1. FSV Mainz 05\n\n##Short Summary\n\nAnother carnival club. So when you like that and also want everyone to speak an inscrutable dialect, choose Mainz. [Current kit.](https://shop.mainz05.de/out/pictures/generated/product/1/665_665_60/image_1000383_1.jpg) [No.](https://kinder.ksta.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/237bde6823.jpg)\n\n##Playing Style\nPretty bad this season. Another bog-standard Bundesliga side. Pressing, check. Fluent attacking every now and then, check. You get the idea.\n\n##Overview\n\nPoor Mainz. They have a decent squad with lots of talented players, as shown when they beat Hoffenheim 5-1 or in their other victories. But rarely have I seen a team occasionally collapse as badly as they do since Hamburg was relegated. In just the third league match, they were battered 1-6 by Bayern. Too bad that about two months later, Leipzig took up that challenge and completely, utterly destroyed them in a 0-8 dismantling. Consequently, manager Sandro Schwarz was released in November and succeeded by Achim Beierlorzer, who you might remember was let go by K\u00f6ln not that much earlier. He didn\u2019t do terribly, especially given his tenure at K\u00f6ln, but Mainz is still in deep trouble, being just four points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nFun fact: Mainz also dropped out of the DFB-Pokal in the first round, losing to Kaiserslautern. Not as funny as Augsburg\u2019s mishap, but a good effort nonetheless.\n\n##Who to watch?\n\nMoussa Niakhat\u00e9 is a good centre-back, and Robin Quaison has scored twelve goals this season, showing he\u2019s got what it takes to succeed in the Bundesliga.\n\n---\n\n#Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf\n\n##Short Summary\n\nYou want to stan an American keeper, or you like the thrill of fighting an uphill battle. [Current kit.](https://cdn03.plentymarkets.com/9qo80kzq86u2/item/images/8179/full/1003530011895---1-uhlsport-fortuna-duesseldorf-Heimtrikot-2019-2010-tradition.jpeg) D\u00fcsseldorf doesn\u2019t have a mascot, [but this was the second result when I searched for it anyway.](https://mobil.express.de/image/3466068/2x1/600/300/51f9a359b17fbcd369f8830e7bfd7a14/xl/01d-15-71-78991623-ori-jpg.jpg)\n\n##Playing Style\n\nMuch improved under their new manager. Surprisingly energetic and lively football for a team in 16th, with lapses in defense costing them crucial points.\n\n##Overview\n\nYou know you\u2019re in a bad spot when you\u2019re 16th in the league and no one is too surprised by it. Bar some exceptions \u4e00 Erik Thommy, Zackary Steffen, Kaan Ayhan or Kevin St\u00f6ger come to mind \u4e00, their squad simply isn\u2019t good enough to stay in the league by virtue of individual quality alone. No remarkable results to speak of outside of a 3-3 draw against Schalke, the only thing worth mentioning is that they released Bundesliga legend Friedhelm Funkel and hired Uwe R\u00f6sler, who you might know from his years in the Premier League. Until that point, D\u00fcsseldorf wasn\u2019t even comically bad, they were just a sad bunch of underperformers.\n\nUnder R\u00f6sler, D\u00fcsseldorf has a league record 1-4-1, a respectable tally for a side under this much pressure. They have a long way to go if they want to leave the relegation zone for good, but so far they have come across as revitalised, showing that playing to the strength of your players elevates a team above the quality of the individuals. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and so on.\n\nAs /u/SamCooper07 pointed out to me, D\u00fcsseldorf has a special connection to Ipswich Town, about which you can read [here](https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/fortuna-blues-visit-ipswich-town-2020-1-6453889).\n\nFun fact: they reached the semi-finals in the DFB-Pokal and were booted out by Saarbr\u00fccken.\n\n##Who to watch?\n\nKeeper Zackary Steffen, on loan from Manchester City, is a good one and proved he\u2019s too good to rot on the bench, although he\u2019s currently injured. If you\u2019re more of a connoisseur, an appreciator of the fine arts, then Kevin St\u00f6ger is right up your alley. He\u2019s a midfield metronome, playing precise passes, being a creative driving force. Seriously, he\u2019s really, really good, and we will no doubt be seeing him at an international club soon.\n\n---\n\n#Werder Bremen\n\n##Short Summary\n\nThis is the end  \nBeautiful friend  \nThis is the end  \nMy only friend, the end  \n\nOf our elaborate plans, the end  \nOf everything that stands, the end  \nNo safety or surprise, the end  \nI'll never look into your eyes again  \n\n[Current kit.](https://cdn02.plentymarkets.com/r08hdwlu0xo0/item/images/95823/full/Werder-Bremen-Trikot-Home-19-20-Pizarro-14.jpg) [Mascot.](https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/fmFZcNvFHTzZO17AtCRrdk5L29Q=/1400x932/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LUHXTHKN6FAYFOIWFB42TBQFOM.jpg)\n\n##Playing Style\n\nSorrow, despair, mixed with a hint of longing for the warm embrace of Max Kruse, all set to [their new anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y11f8Oc25AI).\n\n##Overview\n\nBremen have crashed spectacularly this season. Conceding the most goals in the league while being joint last in the scoring department, it\u2019s easy to see why they are in the second-to-last place. As is so often the case, statistics alone don\u2019t provide a complete picture of the situation. At times, Bremen play well. No really, they do! Not amazingly well, admittedly, but certainly better than their standing implies. However, they only play well until they concede or face too much pressure. Suddenly, all of the intelligent pressing ceases, defenders start to resemble headless chickens, and scoring goals seems like a distant dream, lost among the sands of time. In a distant place among a sea of dandelions, sunshine glistens in a solitary tear shed by Thomas Schaaf whenever Bremen play another match.\n\nManager Florian Kohfeldt was seen as the next big thing in German football. A tactician as well as a motivator, he was at times rumoured to replace Lucien Favre in Dortmund. While his Bremen side, despite their struggles, defeated Dortmund in the Pokal, that was merely a temporary band-aid for their woes in the league. Already trailing D\u00fcsseldorf by four points, the prospect of them clawing their way out of the relegation zone appears far fetched, a pipe dream. Under normal circumstances they would have the quality to achieve that feat, no doubts about that, but under these supposed normal circumstances they wouldn\u2019t be in that dire situation in the first place.\n\nWhat is there left to say but reminisce about football\u2019s fickle nature? Sometimes, without rhyme or reason, clubs wake up on the wrong foot one day and step in manure over and over, until they don\u2019t reach greener pastures where all that crap accumulated around their feet is the perfect fertiliser.\n\nFun fact sponsored by /u/promocodeclq: the last time Bremen managed to snag a point from Bayern was a 0-0 draw in 2010. Their last win against the Bavarians was a 5-2 in 2008. How times change, eh?\n\n##Who to watch?\n\nLast season\u2019s darling Maximilian Eggestein hasn\u2019t been able to keep up his good form. So the choice is Milot Rashica, a lively, quick winger who can also play as a striker.\n\n---\n\n#SC Paderborn 07\n\n##Short Summary\n\nPaderborn is your team when you value staying true to yourself and your values, even to a fault. [Current kit.](https://11freunde.de/assets/images/bildschirmfoto_2019-08-02_um_17.08.35.png) [Why does it have whiskers?](https://cdn1.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/media.media.8fa22d5e-3559-4ec4-b8a8-34333e339f88.original1024.jpg)\n\n##Playing Style\n\nQuick passing, direct counters, aggressive pressing. At least that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying and mostly failing to do.\n\n##Overview\n\nTheir promotion took many by surprise. With the style mentioned above, they rose through the ranks and achieved the impossible. After nearly being relegated to the fourth division following their brief stint in the top flight of German football, they fought their way back and have gloriously returned. I, among others, highly respect manager Steffen Baumgart for not changing too much about his team\u2019s approach now that they\u2019re back. The only problem is that they\u2019re not in the second league anymore. The players, collectively, aren\u2019t good enough to play that kind of football against first league clubs. Commendable, surely, but ultimately they are dying a beautiful death. Obviously they still got a 3-3 draw against Dortmund, because of course they did, and it shouldn\u2019t go unmentioned that they had Bayern on the ropes in a close 2-3 defeat.\n\nThey would need to gain six points just to draw level with D\u00fcsseldorf as they currently stand. In the name of suspense, the match they\u2019ll play this weekend will be against, you guessed it, D\u00fcsseldorf. A decisive match that could either reignite a last flame of hope or fully and utterly extinguish it. Their other fixtures are a mixed bag, facing off against Gladbach, Leipzig and Dortmund on the one hand, while also having to play against Bremen and Augsburg. A lot could happen in the remainder of the season, but anything other than direct relegation would prove to be a monumental feat.\n\n##Who to watch?\n\nJust like Union Berlin, Paderborn doesn\u2019t have one player overshadowing the rest. Instead, be assured that you\u2019ll be seeing several of them at other Bundesliga sides (or elsewhere in Europe) next season, regardless of Paderborn\u2019s ultimate fate. Luca Kilian, Klaus Gjasula, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Sebastian Vasiliadis, and Streli Mamba are all quite good and could thrive in the right team.\n\n---\n\nAnd that\u2019s it.

Another bog-standard Bundesliga side. Pressing, check. Fluent attacking every now and then, check. You get the idea.</p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Poor Mainz. They have a decent squad with lots of talented players, as shown when they beat Hoffenheim 5-1 or in their other victories. But rarely have I seen a team occasionally collapse as badly as they do since Hamburg was relegated. In just the third league match, they were battered 1-6 by Bayern. Too bad that about two months later, Leipzig took up that challenge and completely, utterly destroyed them in a 0-8 dismantling. Consequently, manager Sandro Schwarz was released in November and succeeded by Achim Beierlorzer, who you might remember was let go by K\u00f6ln not that much earlier. He didn\u2019t do terribly, especially given his tenure at K\u00f6ln, but Mainz is still in deep trouble, being just four points clear of the relegation zone.</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact: Mainz also dropped out of the DFB-Pokal in the first round, losing to Kaiserslautern. Not as funny as Augsburg\u2019s mishap, but a good effort nonetheless.</p>\n\n<h2>Who to watch?</h2>\n\n<p>Moussa Niakhat\u00e9 is a good centre-back, and Robin Quaison has scored twelve goals this season, showing he\u2019s got what it takes to succeed in the Bundesliga.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf</h1>\n\n<h2>Short Summary</h2>\n\n<p>You want to stan an American keeper, or you like the thrill of fighting an uphill battle. <a href=\"https://cdn03.plentymarkets.com/9qo80kzq86u2/item/images/8179/full/1003530011895---1-uhlsport-fortuna-duesseldorf-Heimtrikot-2019-2010-tradition.jpeg\">Current kit.</a> D\u00fcsseldorf doesn\u2019t have a mascot, <a href=\"https://mobil.express.de/image/3466068/2x1/600/300/51f9a359b17fbcd369f8830e7bfd7a14/xl/01d-15-71-78991623-ori-jpg.jpg\">but this was the second result when I searched for it anyway.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Playing Style</h2>\n\n<p>Much improved under their new manager. Surprisingly energetic and lively football for a team in 16th, with lapses in defense costing them crucial points.</p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>You know you\u2019re in a bad spot when you\u2019re 16th in the league and no one is too surprised by it. Bar some exceptions \u4e00 Erik Thommy, Zackary Steffen, Kaan Ayhan or Kevin St\u00f6ger come to mind \u4e00, their squad simply isn\u2019t good enough to stay in the league by virtue of individual quality alone. No remarkable results to speak of outside of a 3-3 draw against Schalke, the only thing worth mentioning is that they released Bundesliga legend Friedhelm Funkel and hired Uwe R\u00f6sler, who you might know from his years in the Premier League. Until that point, D\u00fcsseldorf wasn\u2019t even comically bad, they were just a sad bunch of underperformers.</p>\n\n<p>Under R\u00f6sler, D\u00fcsseldorf has a league record 1-4-1, a respectable tally for a side under this much pressure. They have a long way to go if they want to leave the relegation zone for good, but so far they have come across as revitalised, showing that playing to the strength of your players elevates a team above the quality of the individuals. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"/u/SamCooper07\">/u/SamCooper07</a> pointed out to me, D\u00fcsseldorf has a special connection to Ipswich Town, about which you can read <a href=\"https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/fortuna-blues-visit-ipswich-town-2020-1-6453889\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact: they reached the semi-finals in the DFB-Pokal and were booted out by Saarbr\u00fccken.</p>\n\n<h2>Who to watch?</h2>\n\n<p>Keeper Zackary Steffen, on loan from Manchester City, is a good one and proved he\u2019s too good to rot on the bench, although he\u2019s currently injured. If you\u2019re more of a connoisseur, an appreciator of the fine arts, then Kevin St\u00f6ger is right up your alley. He\u2019s a midfield metronome, playing precise passes, being a creative driving force. Seriously, he\u2019s really, really good, and we will no doubt be seeing him at an international club soon.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Werder Bremen</h1>\n\n<h2>Short Summary</h2>\n\n<p>This is the end<br/>\nBeautiful friend<br/>\nThis is the end<br/>\nMy only friend, the end  </p>\n\n<p>Of our elaborate plans, the end<br/>\nOf everything that stands, the end<br/>\nNo safety or surprise, the end<br/>\nI&#39;ll never look into your eyes again  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn02.plentymarkets.com/r08hdwlu0xo0/item/images/95823/full/Werder-Bremen-Trikot-Home-19-20-Pizarro-14.jpg\">Current kit.</a> <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/fmFZcNvFHTzZO17AtCRrdk5L29Q=/1400x932/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LUHXTHKN6FAYFOIWFB42TBQFOM.jpg\">Mascot.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Playing Style</h2>\n\n<p>Sorrow, despair, mixed with a hint of longing for the warm embrace of Max Kruse, all set to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y11f8Oc25AI\">their new anthem</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Bremen have crashed spectacularly this season. Conceding the most goals in the league while being joint last in the scoring department, it\u2019s easy to see why they are in the second-to-last place. As is so often the case, statistics alone don\u2019t provide a complete picture of the situation. At times, Bremen play well. No really, they do! Not amazingly well, admittedly, but certainly better than their standing implies. However, they only play well until they concede or face too much pressure. Suddenly, all of the intelligent pressing ceases, defenders start to resemble headless chickens, and scoring goals seems like a distant dream, lost among the sands of time. In a distant place among a sea of dandelions, sunshine glistens in a solitary tear shed by Thomas Schaaf whenever Bremen play another match.</p>\n\n<p>Manager Florian Kohfeldt was seen as the next big thing in German football. A tactician as well as a motivator, he was at times rumoured to replace Lucien Favre in Dortmund. While his Bremen side, despite their struggles, defeated Dortmund in the Pokal, that was merely a temporary band-aid for their woes in the league. Already trailing D\u00fcsseldorf by four points, the prospect of them clawing their way out of the relegation zone appears far fetched, a pipe dream. Under normal circumstances they would have the quality to achieve that feat, no doubts about that, but under these supposed normal circumstances they wouldn\u2019t be in that dire situation in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>What is there left to say but reminisce about football\u2019s fickle nature? Sometimes, without rhyme or reason, clubs wake up on the wrong foot one day and step in manure over and over, until they don\u2019t reach greener pastures where all that crap accumulated around their feet is the perfect fertiliser.</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact sponsored by <a href=\"/u/promocodeclq\">/u/promocodeclq</a>: the last time Bremen managed to snag a point from Bayern was a 0-0 draw in 2010. Their last win against the Bavarians was a 5-2 in 2008. How times change, eh?</p>\n\n<h2>Who to watch?</h2>\n\n<p>Last season\u2019s darling Maximilian Eggestein hasn\u2019t been able to keep up his good form. So the choice is Milot Rashica, a lively, quick winger who can also play as a striker.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>SC Paderborn 07</h1>\n\n<h2>Short Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Paderborn is your team when you value staying true to yourself and your values, even to a fault. <a href=\"https://11freunde.de/assets/images/bildschirmfoto_2019-08-02_um_17.08.35.png\">Current kit.</a> <a href=\"https://cdn1.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/media.media.8fa22d5e-3559-4ec4-b8a8-34333e339f88.original1024.jpg\">Why does it have whiskers?</a></p>\n\n<h2>Playing Style</h2>\n\n<p>Quick passing, direct counters, aggressive pressing. At least that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying and mostly failing to do.</p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Their promotion took many by surprise. With the style mentioned above, they rose through the ranks and achieved the impossible. After nearly being relegated to the fourth division following their brief stint in the top flight of German football, they fought their way back and have gloriously returned. I, among others, highly respect manager Steffen Baumgart for not changing too much about his team\u2019s approach now that they\u2019re back. The only problem is that they\u2019re not in the second league anymore. The players, collectively, aren\u2019t good enough to play that kind of football against first league clubs. Commendable, surely, but ultimately they are dying a beautiful death. Obviously they still got a 3-3 draw against Dortmund, because of course they did, and it shouldn\u2019t go unmentioned that they had Bayern on the ropes in a close 2-3 defeat.</p>\n\n<p>They would need to gain six points just to draw level with D\u00fcsseldorf as they currently stand. In the name of suspense, the match they\u2019ll play this weekend will be against, you guessed it, D\u00fcsseldorf. A decisive match that could either reignite a last flame of hope or fully and utterly extinguish it. Their other fixtures are a mixed bag, facing off against Gladbach, Leipzig and Dortmund on the one hand, while also having to play against Bremen and Augsburg. A lot could happen in the remainder of the season, but anything other than direct relegation would prove to be a monumental feat.</p>\n\n<h2>Who to watch?</h2>\n\n<p>Just like Union Berlin, Paderborn doesn\u2019t have one player overshadowing the rest. Instead, be assured that you\u2019ll be seeing several of them at other Bundesliga sides (or elsewhere in Europe) next season, regardless of Paderborn\u2019s ultimate fate. Luca Kilian, Klaus Gjasula, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Sebastian Vasiliadis, and Streli Mamba are all quite good and could thrive in the right team.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>And that\u2019s it.

Obviously, it is pretty indisputable that he is one of the best in the world. However, he is one of the more polarizing players in football and gets a lot of hate. Some call him the 3rd best in the world, others say he\u2019s wasting away his career in France. I\u2019m aiming to do this series of posts on lots of controversial players that people don\u2019t agree on ability-wise, I find it interesting to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. So, let\u2019s get into it with Brazil\u2019s golden boy. \n\n**DRIBBLING**\n\n2019/20 - Ligue 1 - 1st in dribbles completed per game (6) (astonishingly higher than 2nd most of 3.5)\n\n2018/19 - Ligue 1 - 2nd in dribbles completed per game* (4.4) (Ben Arfa is 1st with 4.5)\n\n2017/18 - Ligue 1 - 1st in dribbles completed per game (7.1) (ridiculous amount, 2nd most is 3.6)\n\n2016/17 - La Liga - 1st in dribbles completed per game (5.6) (Messi is 2nd with 3.7)\n\n2015/16 - La Liga - 1st in dribbles completed per game (4.2) (Messi is 2nd with 3.5)\n\n2014/15 - La Liga - 2nd in most dribbles completed per game (3.2) (Messi is 1st with 4.6)\n\n2013/14 - La Liga - 3rd in most dribbles completed per game (3) (Messi/Brahimi are 1st with 4.6)\n\nThese statistics are quite absurd, and say a few things. First, the obvious that we already know, is that Neymar is one of the best in the world at beating defenders. His seasons in Ligue 1 have been tarnished with injuries, but he has been absolutely tearing up the league when he\u2019s played. 6 and 7.1 are incredible numbers of take-ons for a game, the highest averages of anyone in Europe. So, with lots of hate on the French league, people will be asking: is it because Ligue 1 is weaker? Defenders are easier to beat? Or has Neymar improved as a player since joining PSG? Probably some of both, as with most things in football, it\u2019s hard to come up with a clear answer. We can also compare him to players across Europe, using the same metrics as I did for Hazard, his success rate and number of dribbles completed since Opta started recording statistics in the 2006/07 season:\n* Neymar is 10th among Europe\u2019s top 5 leagues for take-ons completed since Opta started recording stats. NOW, this does him a disservice, for a number of reasons though: first of all, he\u2019s been injured for much of his career, giving other players more opportunities to pass him. Second of all, all the other top 10 have been playing in Europe longer than him. So I would actually dismiss this statistic somewhat in his case.\n* A more reliable way to measure it is to take these 10 players and measure by success rate of the dribbles they complete. In this case, Neymar is 7th, with a lower success rate than Ben Arfa, Joaquin, Firmino, Hazard, Messi, and Iniesta. \n\nWhat these stats say, pretty simply, is that Neymar is among European football\u2019s elite players with the ball at his feet. Not controversial or surprising at all, honestly. \n\n**GOALSCORING**\n\n2019/20 - Ligue 1 - 4th in goals scored (15) (in 15 league appearances)\n\n2018/19 - Ligue 1 - Joint 5th in goals scored (15) (in 17 league appearances)\n\n2017/18 - Ligue 1 - Joint 3rd in goals scored (19) (in 20 league appearances)\n\n2016/17 - La Liga - Joint 9th in goals scored (Messi tops it with 37)\n\n2015/16 - La Liga - Joint 4th in goals scored (24) (Suarez tops it with 40)\n\n2014/15 - La Liga - Joint 3rd in goals scored (22) (Ronaldo gets 48 and Messi gets 43 lol jesus)\n\n2013/14 - La Liga - 28th in goals scored (9) (Ronaldo tops with 31)\n\n\nI\u2019d actually say, in the same manner of his dribbling statistics, his goalscoring stats do point to a difference in quality with Ligue 1. Yes, he\u2019s scored less due to injuries, but his goals per minute are much higher in France than they were in Spain. He averages about a goal per game at PSG. Again, some might argue he\u2019s improved, but I\u2019d say finding the back of the net is also easier in Ligue 1. \n\n\nStatistics recorded on January 28, 2020, showed Neymar averages a goal every 88 minutes in Ligue 1, the 6th best goals per minute ratio in Europe, better than both Messi and Ronaldo. The five players ahead of him on the list were all strikers. So, as a winger seeing the amount of goals he has scored in La Liga and in Ligue 1 despite his injuries, it is pretty easy to confirm that Neymar is one of the most prolific wingers in all of Europe. \n\n\n**CREATIVITY**\n\n2019/20  - Ligue 1 - Joint 4th in most assists (6), joint 3rd in key passes per game(2.6)\n\n2018/19 - Ligue 1 - 5th in most assists (7), 4th in key passes per game (2.5)\n\n2017/18 - Ligue 1 - Joint 1st in most assists (13), 2nd in key passes per game (3.5)\n\n2016/17 - La Liga - 3rd in most assists (11), 1st in key passes per game (3)\n\n2015/16 - La Liga - 4th in most assists (12), 1st in key passes per game (3)\n\n2014/15 - La Liga - Joint 13th in most assists (7), joint 17th in key passes per game (1.6)\n\n2013/14 - La Liga - Joint 12th in most assists (7), joint 18th in key passes per game (1.6)\n\n\nIn Europe, Neymar has gotten more creative and better output as the seasons have gone on, especially after his first two years at Barcelona. In the last 5 years, his creativity is almost unparalleled, always averaging in the top 4 highest average key passes in the league, and topping La Liga two years in a row. He\u2019s been averaging slightly more assists per game at PSG, but I think is also able to play more selfishly because he\u2019s the focal point of their team along with Mbappe, as opposed to sharing the plaudits with both prime Messi and prime Suarez having seasons they score 40+ goals. Furthermore, if you look at ALL COMPETITIONS on TransferMarkt, you will find that since moving to Europe, Neymar has amassed 116 assists in club football. Very very good numbers, that ranks highly among other European wingers, and is especially impressive once you consider he\u2019s also been averaging a goal per game the last few years. Tremendous impact here. \n\n**BIG GAMES - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, CUP FINALS, WORLD CUP**\n\nThe biggest games in Neymar\u2019s career have come at Barcelona and internationally, because PSG shit the bed in the Champions League every single season. Let\u2019s take a look.\nOf course, Neymar has played in 1 Champions League final in his career, in 2015 against Juventus. He found the back of the net this game to make it 3-1 with seconds remaining. I don\u2019t remember his performance well, but on a number of Match Rating sites, he is put 2nd behind Messi as Barca\u2019s best player on the day. \n\nHe also played in 3 Copa Del Rey finals from 2015 to 2017, and scored a goal in all 3 of them. And, going back as far as 2011 with Santos, he scored a decisive goal in the second leg of a 2-1 win in the Copa Libertadores final. \n\nAside from his very impressive record of scoring in most cup finals he\u2019s played in, Neymar has also dealt with the immense pressure of being Brazil\u2019s star at two World Cups. He has 6 goals and 3 assists in 10 total World Cup appearances, showing he does indeed perform on the big stage. His 2014 World Cup performances were especially impressive before they were cut short by injury. \n\nHowever, summarizing above, Neymar is indeed a big game player. He\u2019s scored in many cup finals and been Brazil\u2019s most productive attacking player throughout his career. His career in the Champions League with PSG has been disappointing, never even reaching the QFs, although of course he was injured when Manchester United knocked them out. The season before, though, he failed to be PSG\u2019s star and make an impact as they were knocked out by Real Madrid 5-2 on aggregate. \n\n**SUMMARY** \n\n* *Based on statistics about his dribbling, passing, and scoring goals, very few players can compete with Neymar.*  **I\u2019d argue, since his move to Europe in 2013, he has been the 3rd best attacking player behind Messi and Ronaldo.** *His dribbles completed, assist, key pass, and goal per minute outputs are all insane.*\n\n* *At age 28, Neymar has one Champions League medal, and has yet to go past the Ro16 with PSG. Yet, more of these disappointments are because of Neymar\u2019s injuries than his actual performances in Europe.

Obviously, it is pretty indisputable that he is one of the best in the world. However, he is one of the more polarizing players in football and gets a lot of hate. Some call him the 3rd best in the world, others say he\u2019s wasting away his career in France. I\u2019m aiming to do this series of posts on lots of controversial players that people don\u2019t agree on ability-wise, I find it interesting to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. So, let\u2019s get into it with Brazil\u2019s golden boy. </p>\n\n<p><strong>DRIBBLING</strong></p>\n\n<p>2019/20 - Ligue 1 - 1st in dribbles completed per game (6) (astonishingly higher than 2nd most of 3.5)</p>\n\n<p>2018/19 - Ligue 1 - 2nd in dribbles completed per game* (4.4) (Ben Arfa is 1st with 4.5)</p>\n\n<p>2017/18 - Ligue 1 - 1st in dribbles completed per game (7.1) (ridiculous amount, 2nd most is 3.6)</p>\n\n<p>2016/17 - La Liga - 1st in dribbles completed per game (5.6) (Messi is 2nd with 3.7)</p>\n\n<p>2015/16 - La Liga - 1st in dribbles completed per game (4.2) (Messi is 2nd with 3.5)</p>\n\n<p>2014/15 - La Liga - 2nd in most dribbles completed per game (3.2) (Messi is 1st with 4.6)</p>\n\n<p>2013/14 - La Liga - 3rd in most dribbles completed per game (3) (Messi/Brahimi are 1st with 4.6)</p>\n\n<p>These statistics are quite absurd, and say a few things. First, the obvious that we already know, is that Neymar is one of the best in the world at beating defenders. His seasons in Ligue 1 have been tarnished with injuries, but he has been absolutely tearing up the league when he\u2019s played. 6 and 7.1 are incredible numbers of take-ons for a game, the highest averages of anyone in Europe. So, with lots of hate on the French league, people will be asking: is it because Ligue 1 is weaker? Defenders are easier to beat? Or has Neymar improved as a player since joining PSG? Probably some of both, as with most things in football, it\u2019s hard to come up with a clear answer. We can also compare him to players across Europe, using the same metrics as I did for Hazard, his success rate and number of dribbles completed since Opta started recording statistics in the 2006/07 season:\n* Neymar is 10th among Europe\u2019s top 5 leagues for take-ons completed since Opta started recording stats. NOW, this does him a disservice, for a number of reasons though: first of all, he\u2019s been injured for much of his career, giving other players more opportunities to pass him. Second of all, all the other top 10 have been playing in Europe longer than him. So I would actually dismiss this statistic somewhat in his case.\n* A more reliable way to measure it is to take these 10 players and measure by success rate of the dribbles they complete. In this case, Neymar is 7th, with a lower success rate than Ben Arfa, Joaquin, Firmino, Hazard, Messi, and Iniesta. </p>\n\n<p>What these stats say, pretty simply, is that Neymar is among European football\u2019s elite players with the ball at his feet. Not controversial or surprising at all, honestly. </p>\n\n<p><strong>GOALSCORING</strong></p>\n\n<p>2019/20 - Ligue 1 - 4th in goals scored (15) (in 15 league appearances)</p>\n\n<p>2018/19 - Ligue 1 - Joint 5th in goals scored (15) (in 17 league appearances)</p>\n\n<p>2017/18 - Ligue 1 - Joint 3rd in goals scored (19) (in 20 league appearances)</p>\n\n<p>2016/17 - La Liga - Joint 9th in goals scored (Messi tops it with 37)</p>\n\n<p>2015/16 - La Liga - Joint 4th in goals scored (24) (Suarez tops it with 40)</p>\n\n<p>2014/15 - La Liga - Joint 3rd in goals scored (22) (Ronaldo gets 48 and Messi gets 43 lol jesus)</p>\n\n<p>2013/14 - La Liga - 28th in goals scored (9) (Ronaldo tops with 31)</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d actually say, in the same manner of his dribbling statistics, his goalscoring stats do point to a difference in quality with Ligue 1. Yes, he\u2019s scored less due to injuries, but his goals per minute are much higher in France than they were in Spain. He averages about a goal per game at PSG. Again, some might argue he\u2019s improved, but I\u2019d say finding the back of the net is also easier in Ligue 1. </p>\n\n<p>Statistics recorded on January 28, 2020, showed Neymar averages a goal every 88 minutes in Ligue 1, the 6th best goals per minute ratio in Europe, better than both Messi and Ronaldo. The five players ahead of him on the list were all strikers. So, as a winger seeing the amount of goals he has scored in La Liga and in Ligue 1 despite his injuries, it is pretty easy to confirm that Neymar is one of the most prolific wingers in all of Europe. </p>\n\n<p><strong>CREATIVITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>2019/20  - Ligue 1 - Joint 4th in most assists (6), joint 3rd in key passes per game(2.6)</p>\n\n<p>2018/19 - Ligue 1 - 5th in most assists (7), 4th in key passes per game (2.5)</p>\n\n<p>2017/18 - Ligue 1 - Joint 1st in most assists (13), 2nd in key passes per game (3.5)</p>\n\n<p>2016/17 - La Liga - 3rd in most assists (11), 1st in key passes per game (3)</p>\n\n<p>2015/16 - La Liga - 4th in most assists (12), 1st in key passes per game (3)</p>\n\n<p>2014/15 - La Liga - Joint 13th in most assists (7), joint 17th in key passes per game (1.6)</p>\n\n<p>2013/14 - La Liga - Joint 12th in most assists (7), joint 18th in key passes per game (1.6)</p>\n\n<p>In Europe, Neymar has gotten more creative and better output as the seasons have gone on, especially after his first two years at Barcelona. In the last 5 years, his creativity is almost unparalleled, always averaging in the top 4 highest average key passes in the league, and topping La Liga two years in a row. He\u2019s been averaging slightly more assists per game at PSG, but I think is also able to play more selfishly because he\u2019s the focal point of their team along with Mbappe, as opposed to sharing the plaudits with both prime Messi and prime Suarez having seasons they score 40+ goals. Furthermore, if you look at ALL COMPETITIONS on TransferMarkt, you will find that since moving to Europe, Neymar has amassed 116 assists in club football. Very very good numbers, that ranks highly among other European wingers, and is especially impressive once you consider he\u2019s also been averaging a goal per game the last few years. Tremendous impact here. </p>\n\n<p><strong>BIG GAMES - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, CUP FINALS, WORLD CUP</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biggest games in Neymar\u2019s career have come at Barcelona and internationally, because PSG shit the bed in the Champions League every single season. Let\u2019s take a look.\nOf course, Neymar has played in 1 Champions League final in his career, in 2015 against Juventus. He found the back of the net this game to make it 3-1 with seconds remaining. I don\u2019t remember his performance well, but on a number of Match Rating sites, he is put 2nd behind Messi as Barca\u2019s best player on the day. </p>\n\n<p>He also played in 3 Copa Del Rey finals from 2015 to 2017, and scored a goal in all 3 of them. And, going back as far as 2011 with Santos, he scored a decisive goal in the second leg of a 2-1 win in the Copa Libertadores final. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from his very impressive record of scoring in most cup finals he\u2019s played in, Neymar has also dealt with the immense pressure of being Brazil\u2019s star at two World Cups. He has 6 goals and 3 assists in 10 total World Cup appearances, showing he does indeed perform on the big stage. His 2014 World Cup performances were especially impressive before they were cut short by injury. </p>\n\n<p>However, summarizing above, Neymar is indeed a big game player. He\u2019s scored in many cup finals and been Brazil\u2019s most productive attacking player throughout his career. His career in the Champions League with PSG has been disappointing, never even reaching the QFs, although of course he was injured when Manchester United knocked them out. The season before, though, he failed to be PSG\u2019s star and make an impact as they were knocked out by Real Madrid 5-2 on aggregate. </p>\n\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Based on statistics about his dribbling, passing, and scoring goals, very few players can compete with Neymar.</em>  <strong>I\u2019d argue, since his move to Europe in 2013, he has been the 3rd best attacking player behind Messi and Ronaldo.</strong> <em>His dribbles completed, assist, key pass, and goal per minute outputs are all insane.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>At age 28, Neymar has one Champions League medal, and has yet to go past the Ro16 with PSG. Yet, more of these disappointments are because of Neymar\u2019s injuries than his actual performances in Europe. Based on his record of scoring in cup finals, he is undoubtedly a big game player.</em> </p></li>\n<li><p><em>His attitude can make people hate him, especially how he spent half the 2018 World Cup crying on the ground, but it doesn\u2019t change how good he is.</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading another one of these, I\u2019ll probably write another one soon about a different player, possibly a defender next time. I find it interesting to analyze player\u2019s statistics and achievements over the course of their career.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": ":Chelsea:", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "gj8auw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DidierDrogbaII", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 53, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/soccer/comments/gj8auw/oc_how_good_is_neymar_career_analysis_pt2/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/gj8auw/oc_how_good_is_neymar_career_analysis_pt2/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2015108, "created_utc": 1589405570.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "after": "t3_gj8auw", "before": null}}
