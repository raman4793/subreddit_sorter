Long read, sorry!\n\nHe's 36, I'm 37 (F). \n\nHe's always been into conspiracy theories- it's not been a big deal to me.  But since last year it's gotten worse, and with COVID almost intolerable.\n\nI feel like it's gotten worse because he's unemployed and spends his entire day watching YouTube videos of the conspiracy sort. I've addressed it before because it put a major financial strain on us when I was ill and missed a lot of work.  Before COVID we weren't scarce with jobs in our area. He just wants to do what ever is the easiest least human-contact type work possible.  We're good financially because of how much I make, I just wish he'd contribute and help more instead of vegging out all day.\n\nBesides that, now he continually pushes this Fake-Pandemic stuff on me, tries to get me to watch videos. I even debunked a video he sent me about the dangers of 5G. I've asked him to stop sending me this stuff and not discuss it. I don't agree with his views and don't want to debate it EVERY DAY. \n\nLast week was a tipping point it was almost daily he would call me a coward, a sheep, stupid and ignorant for not wanting to partake. He then eluded to leaving me because I was naive in believing the media. It upset me that such a thing would make you leave a person.  I told him I don't want to spend the time or energy on gobbling up the same rhetoric day in and day out. I work! I want to relax when I'm not working. I don't even watch the news! He knows this.

I want to listen to someone else's opinion so here I am. Please read and give me an honest opinion.\n\nI've been friends with this girl for almost a year. Let's call her Laura. Laura is openly gay and quite popular inside my group of friends. Everyone I know is friends with her and really loves her. We're not best friends or anything but I first thought she was really sweet. I used to think she was kind and she has helped me countless times. She has a charismatic personality and gets along with everyone. We're not even that close, but we just have lots of mutual friends. That's how we met.\n\nLaura used to live with her girlfriend, but they broke up. I heard it was a messy breakup and her girlfriend kicked her out last month. Due to the pandemic, she couldn't find a place to stay (She's not on good terms with her family members) Most of our friends went to stay with their family or they don't have space. I was the only one living alone and I have plenty of space in my apartment so another friend suggested that she live with me until she could find another place.\n\nLaura has been living with me for a month and a half, and I'm sick and tired of her disgusting behaviour. She's a lesbian and I don't have a problem with that, but I have a problem with her shoving it in my face LITERALLY. \n\nShe walks around naked and I have to tell her to put on some clothes. She constantly asks me if I want to try lesbian sex, or if I'm interested. She questions me about my sex life and comments that she can pleasure me better than any man. She slaps my butt when I walk by and laughs and jokes about it when I get angry. She's always playful and keeps grabbing me everywhere and laughs about it.\n\nI have made it clear that I'm 100% straight and I have zero interest in her, but Laura keeps pushing me to try having sex with her. She actually made me watch lesbian porn because she said I might become interested after watching. I refused so many times but she's just so pushy! I'm a huge people pleaser and I'm having a hard time telling her no. She's really persistent. She keeps pushing and pushing until I just reluctantly agree so she'll shut the fuck up.\n\nWe made out once because she wouldn't stop bringing it up. She kept begging for four days straight and I ended up agreeing to it. We kissed for a bit and I pushed her away when she grabbed my boobs and tried to slip her hand into my pyjamas. I told her it didn't work, I was not turned on at all and I didn't want to do it again.\n\nA few days ago, she kissed me while I was taking a nap in the living room. I got very angry and shouted at her to get out of my house. We had a small fight which ended in her crying. She cried like half an hour and asked me if I was disgusted because she was a lesbian. I ended up apologizing and consoling her because she was genuinely crying, as if she's not aware of her own behaviour.\n\nThat didn't improve her behaviour at all. Now she's even more persistent. She keeps telling me to just try it once and I'm at my tipping point. I feel like I should just sleep with her and get it over with. Why is she doing this to me? I'm not interested, goddammit!\n\nTwo days ago, I told her that I wanted her to leave. She just began crying and called a few of our friends. I was flooded with calls and messages after that telling me what a homophobic bitch I was. Now they all think I'm homophobic. I am not! How the fuck do I explain this?\n\nEven my best friend of five years called me to ask me what had happened and why I was being homophobic. They thought I was kicking her out because she's a lesbian! I honestly had no idea what to do. I told Laura that she doesn't have to leave and I told my friend that I was okay with her staying for a few more days. Now I'm stuck with her and I can't even tell her to leave.\n\nPlease tell me how I can make this situation better. Why is she so interested in me? Does she have a crush on me? Why is she doing this to me???\n\nTL;DR : my friend is lesbian and she keeps touching me and asking me to have sex with her. she has no place to go and she's living with me.

Original post starts below.\n\n\n\n\nSo for context: we are college students (I am 21F and he\u2019s 21M) who met freshman year (we\u2019re juniors now) through mutual friends and have been acquaintances until this January, when we were in a discussion section for a class together and started talking more. It was just friendly, and stayed that way the whole time (I have had a string of not great romantic/sexual experiences in college and have sort of put a full pause on flirting, dating, etc. for a while and have always been very blunt with my friends, including him, about it). Since the pandemic hit I moved back home and we only communicate over text now. Let\u2019s just call him James.\n\nJames\u2019 roommate, Leon [22M], is tight with one of my best friends, Sam [21M]. Leon decided to move back home when school shut down as well, and while he was packing, he came across a rolled up small print in the back of their shared closet, and unrolled it to see if it belonged to him or not, The image was a drawing of a girl nude performing a sexually explicit act, and she looks.... exactly like me. Like I\u2019m not even really friends with Leon and he immediately thought \u201coh, that kind of looks like OP\u201d. Face, body type, even BOTH of my birthmarks (one in a very noticeable spot and one he would only know about from me mentioning it in passing) is all eerily similar to me. Leon immediately got spooked and took a photo of it and sent it to Sam because he thought I should be notified of the print\u2019s existence. \n\nSam forwarded it to me and I found the original artist\u2019s Twitter handle off the signature. He\u2019s an NSFW artist who also does commissions and will often post those commissions after completing them, and sure enough, I scrolled back far enough to find what is basically my naked body drawn on this man\u2019s timeline, posted all the way back in FEBRUARY, which means James had paid for it like months ago, maybe right when we found out we had a class together. I\u2019ve been talking to him for months and he\u2019s had this for basically the whole time.\n\nThis discovery was two weeks ago and I feel fucking disgusting and honestly violated. I stopped talking to him for the most part\u2014 but I am afraid that he will circulate the image more if I stop speaking to him entirely or tell him that i know. His roommate promised not to say anything because he was pretty disgusted too and as far as I know he\u2019s stayed true to that. I want to cut James off completely and I want the artist to remove the post of the commission from his Twitter, but I\u2019m so scared and ashamed to reach out because I hate drawing more attention to the fact that this drawing even fucking exists, and I shudder thinking about the artist possibly using reference photos of me for the drawing.\n\nSo I guess my advice requests are:\n\n1. Should I bother trying to get the post taken down and if I do, how do I make sure he does it?\n2. Should I confront James? I never want to speak to this man again but I would be mortified if he circulated the image at all. Should I just block him? Is there someone I should report him to or something?\n3. Is this an overreaction and should I do nothing? I haven\u2019t told any of my friends besides the one who informed me because it makes me so uncomfortable and I need an outside perspective. I have never shown any kind of sexual interest in this man and just wanted to be his friend, and she showed absolutely zero interest in me as well. He\u2019s had this image for months, all while still talking to me and it makes me feel so fucking icky and brings back memories of aforementioned shitty sexual experiences and I just don\u2019t want to be around him.\n\nSorry if this was overly long, I\u2019m just really over my head here.\n\nTLDR: found out my \u201cfriend\u201d commissioned an NSFW drawing that is unmistakably of me from an artist on Twitter and I don\u2019t know how to remove him from my life without worrying about him circulating it or how to get it taken down from Twitter.", "author_fullname": "t2_6gm1c7w1", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Found out my friend commissioned a sexually graphic drawing of me without my knowledge or consent and I don\u2019t know what to do.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_gipjxn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10520, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10520, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1589390970.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589363768.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>EDIT: oh my fucking god???

Who she told me that she blocked early on in our relationship, and here I see text messages between her and him..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I guess I went too far back. I am not going to lie, I went back into the chat history and now I am RIDICULOUSLY HURT. \n\nI will just give you guys the timeline based on what happened. The pieces aren't all together because definitely they talked over snapchat as well. And from what she told me about him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I came along she was hooking up with this guy call him Robert. She told me that he was a guy that she stuck with because he had so many problems and she was addicted to helping him out. Supposedly he had some issues with adderall and keeping a job, and that was her excuse why she was with him. \n\nFrom what I saw over text messages... the main reason she was with him was because this guy was huge. I saw videos of him... and to make matters worse she sent him VIDEOS too which she never has sent to me despite me asking (She says ladies don't do that). Also they were never 'dating dating' they were just hooking up and not only that he would just text her at random hours and she would excitedly come over... Also too this guy was doing this with A LOT OF women. \n\nI come in the picture, turns out my girlfriend tries to use me to make him jealous. He laughs at my haircut and clothing says that I dress out of a clearance rack. While we were dating and even boyfriend girlfriend, my girlfriend told me she wasn't ready to sleep with me. She says that she needs to make sure that a guy is right for her before she can do that, and that she isn't like other girls... ALL The while this guy would text her hey come over I get off early from my dentist appointment and she would leave work early for him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw from messages again hard to know details but basically she told him that if he isn't going to be serious with her she will date me. And he told her to go ahead.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's when we started dating. he texted her sometimes when we were together but the conversations were just like quick life updates no talking...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to say. It seems that my relationship and everything with her was a lie that I was just a backup plan while she had her heart to this other guy. Look I knew full well and before that she messaged this guy time to time I saw some of them before. But to me I thought oh my girlfriend is super caring and wouldn't want this guy to be on the streets or to hurt himself. But in reality it was all a lie. It pisses me off so much that I was the backup. And look its one thing early on in dating, when you don't know someone's personality etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to me it really seemed like I was the clearance bin backup. (No I don't shop at the clearance bin) I don't know what to do here. I want to be happy with her I want to be married. I know she didn't message or sleep with him two months (at least what I saw).\n\nI am hurt, I am pissed off that while she is telling me all this stuff about how she doesn't get into bed quickly with guys, she is at his house at 3pm. I am so hurt its not just oh I am the backup. It's like she is a completely different woman with this guy than she is with me. With me she is super lady like super strict boundaries. With him is like whatever goes. And its ridiculous. We went to Spain last year, and she was upset that I made her pay for the hotel because in her eyes she was raised to be treated a 'certain way by men.' But for this guy she would be the one buying him food all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't even know how confronting her would even work now. She and her sister are living in our shared apartment together. If I confront her this would lead to a break up and I don't even know what to do. My family members have been gotten VISAs for our wedding and now it seems like its all down the drain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do? Do I tell her I saw what she posted on her macbook? Or should I try to guess her to confess? Also is it a good idea to screenshot the messages and send to myself so I can keep for proof? I feel that things could get ugly with her family.

Who she told me that she blocked early on in our relationship, and here I see text messages between her and him..</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And I guess I went too far back. I am not going to lie, I went back into the chat history and now I am RIDICULOUSLY HURT. </p>\n\n<p>I will just give you guys the timeline based on what happened. The pieces aren&#39;t all together because definitely they talked over snapchat as well. And from what she told me about him. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Before I came along she was hooking up with this guy call him Robert. She told me that he was a guy that she stuck with because he had so many problems and she was addicted to helping him out. Supposedly he had some issues with adderall and keeping a job, and that was her excuse why she was with him. </p>\n\n<p>From what I saw over text messages... the main reason she was with him was because this guy was huge. I saw videos of him... and to make matters worse she sent him VIDEOS too which she never has sent to me despite me asking (She says ladies don&#39;t do that). Also they were never &#39;dating dating&#39; they were just hooking up and not only that he would just text her at random hours and she would excitedly come over... Also too this guy was doing this with A LOT OF women. </p>\n\n<p>I come in the picture, turns out my girlfriend tries to use me to make him jealous. He laughs at my haircut and clothing says that I dress out of a clearance rack. While we were dating and even boyfriend girlfriend, my girlfriend told me she wasn&#39;t ready to sleep with me. She says that she needs to make sure that a guy is right for her before she can do that, and that she isn&#39;t like other girls... ALL The while this guy would text her hey come over I get off early from my dentist appointment and she would leave work early for him. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I saw from messages again hard to know details but basically she told him that if he isn&#39;t going to be serious with her she will date me. And he told her to go ahead.....</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s when we started dating. he texted her sometimes when we were together but the conversations were just like quick life updates no talking...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what to say. It seems that my relationship and everything with her was a lie that I was just a backup plan while she had her heart to this other guy. Look I knew full well and before that she messaged this guy time to time I saw some of them before. But to me I thought oh my girlfriend is super caring and wouldn&#39;t want this guy to be on the streets or to hurt himself. But in reality it was all a lie. It pisses me off so much that I was the backup. And look its one thing early on in dating, when you don&#39;t know someone&#39;s personality etc. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But to me it really seemed like I was the clearance bin backup. (No I don&#39;t shop at the clearance bin) I don&#39;t know what to do here. I want to be happy with her I want to be married. I know she didn&#39;t message or sleep with him two months (at least what I saw).</p>\n\n<p>I am hurt, I am pissed off that while she is telling me all this stuff about how she doesn&#39;t get into bed quickly with guys, she is at his house at 3pm. I am so hurt its not just oh I am the backup. It&#39;s like she is a completely different woman with this guy than she is with me. With me she is super lady like super strict boundaries. With him is like whatever goes. And its ridiculous. We went to Spain last year, and she was upset that I made her pay for the hotel because in her eyes she was raised to be treated a &#39;certain way by men.&#39; But for this guy she would be the one buying him food all the time. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t even know how confronting her would even work now. She and her sister are living in our shared apartment together. If I confront her this would lead to a break up and I don&#39;t even know what to do. My family members have been gotten VISAs for our wedding and now it seems like its all down the drain. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What should I do? Do I tell her I saw what she posted on her macbook? Or should I try to guess her to confess? Also is it a good idea to screenshot the messages and send to myself so I can keep for proof? I feel that things could get ugly with her family. Her mom doesn&#39;t like me because she see&#39;s me as dark skin. What is next? Also I will answer whatever parts are necessary. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tl;Dr- I found out that I was the backup guy for my girlfriend when things with her and her ex didn&#39;t workout.

He's 6'0\" and last time he willingly told me his weight he was 295. I managed to convince him to go to a doctor (we now share the same family doctor) and he was started on weightloss medication. He goes through this period where he'll get it filled, take it until he runs out, and then put off getting it filled. To be fair, it is expensive AF and not covered, but I usually have to really nudge him to get it filled. So far he has half a month left at the pharmacy and hasn't had it filled. It's probably been a month.  (Quick edit: Sorry, it is an appetite suppression pill, not specifically weight loss.)\n\nTwo nights ago he told me he needs to start weighing himself everyday. I thought, great, progress! He wants to hold himself accountable. Yesterday he told me he ordered something that would be in at noon (he works a very stressful job, usually nights, so he sleeps during the day.) my heart fell because I thought maybe he'd ordered fast food, which is his easy go-to meal. Noon comes around and I check the front door. He's ordered two 1 liter things of ice cream from Marble Slab (basically a \"pick your ice cream, pick your mixings, we will put it together.\") I was a little worried because that's a big temptation, but after he talked about watching his weight, I thought maybe he would try to control it. Keep in mind this was yesterday.\n\nThis morning I get up with our son and give him a quick breakfast downstairs. The one liter container is empty on the living room table.\n\nMy husband can have a very short fuse. He's an amazing husband and provider, but doesn't handle being criticized well (not in the rage sort of way, but in the \"I've just had one of my personal weaknesses made obvious to me and I feel shame\" sort of way.) I need to stress that I've never felt unsafe or like I can't talk to him about it. We communicate well, and it's been a long road getting here. I've had to learn how to not be as blunt, which has been good for me, because blunt isn't always the way to go with people like my husband.\n\nHusband comes downstairs and I ask him, I think, sort of sadly, if he ate the whole liter last night? His back is immediately up. He tells me no and raises his voice to me (not yelling though) \"Don't look at me like that\". I say \"We just got that yesterday\" while he puts on his shoes and goes outside, slams the door behind him.\n\nI finish feeding kidlet and come upstairs to post this.\n\nHere are some relevant facts:\n\nHis dad is SUPER unhealthy. History of cancer, pre-diabetic (which I believe is now just regular diabetic.) Husband is very sedentary, plays a lot of games, sits at work or is at a standing desk. Yesterday he spent a good portion of the day napping (coming off a night shift and now in self-isolation), or playing games. I managed to get him to go outside to play with our son but it couldn't have been more than 15 minutes because they were back inside by the time I came home. We share a family doctor.\n\nHe is a good man, and a good father, but I am scared shitless that I am going to be a young widow at this point. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to convince him that he needs to get a control of this. I'm sure this is an eating disorder of some kind but I have no idea how to broach the topic or where to go for help. I have to go back to see our family doctor in a few weeks so I can talk about it with him then, but... I'm just scared I'm going to lose him. I'm scared for my son, because my husband loves him SO much and I don't want my son to lose that. Any advice or help would be very appreciated.\n\nWe're in Canada, so if anyone has resources that our country specific, well, there you go.\n\n(He is also 100% against the idea of therapy or counseling. I'm not saying I'm opposed to anyone suggesting that, only that advice on how to actually convince him to try it would be useful because I am out of ideas.)\n\nedit: I should add that I will absolutely be addressing him raising his voice to me.

I say &quot;We just got that yesterday&quot; while he puts on his shoes and goes outside, slams the door behind him.</p>\n\n<p>I finish feeding kidlet and come upstairs to post this.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some relevant facts:</p>\n\n<p>His dad is SUPER unhealthy. History of cancer, pre-diabetic (which I believe is now just regular diabetic.) Husband is very sedentary, plays a lot of games, sits at work or is at a standing desk. Yesterday he spent a good portion of the day napping (coming off a night shift and now in self-isolation), or playing games. I managed to get him to go outside to play with our son but it couldn&#39;t have been more than 15 minutes because they were back inside by the time I came home. We share a family doctor.</p>\n\n<p>He is a good man, and a good father, but I am scared shitless that I am going to be a young widow at this point. I don&#39;t know what to do. I don&#39;t know how to convince him that he needs to get a control of this. I&#39;m sure this is an eating disorder of some kind but I have no idea how to broach the topic or where to go for help. I have to go back to see our family doctor in a few weeks so I can talk about it with him then, but... I&#39;m just scared I&#39;m going to lose him. I&#39;m scared for my son, because my husband loves him SO much and I don&#39;t want my son to lose that. Any advice or help would be very appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re in Canada, so if anyone has resources that our country specific, well, there you go.</p>\n\n<p>(He is also 100% against the idea of therapy or counseling. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m opposed to anyone suggesting that, only that advice on how to actually convince him to try it would be useful because I am out of ideas.)</p>\n\n<p>edit: I should add that I will absolutely be addressing him raising his voice to me. I don&#39;t want anyone to worry or think I&#39;m letting him get away with that. I&#39;ll let him cool down, reflect a bit, and then address it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "gizzg2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Throwawayfood89", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 114, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gizzg2/my_30f_husband_31m_is_severely_overweight_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gizzg2/my_30f_husband_31m_is_severely_overweight_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3053778, "created_utc": 1589379782.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "selftext": "First off, I have no issue with the men being of a different race. \nSo here\u2019s what\u2019s going on.

I also remember the cps visits doing more damage than good once they left; some of the physical abuse turned to emotional and psychological abuse which left lasting marks on each of us. We\u2019re all grown now and we\u2019ve each come to terms with how our parents raised us and our family is pretty chill now. In many ways I\u2019m very glad our family was able to stay together.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get involved if it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for everyone, but I\u2019m having a hard time figuring it out. Like I haven\u2019t even seen the kid and I know nothing aside from what I can hear through my walls. I don\u2019t really know anyone involved more than to just recognize them in building.

I\u2019ve looked into the laws in my area and without seeing the kid I can say if he\u2019s using legal reasonable force, but that\u2019s CPS\u2019s call anyway.

I\u2019ve looked into the laws in my area and without seeing the kid I can say if he\u2019s using legal reasonable force, but that\u2019s CPS\u2019s call anyway. Thank you for encouraging me to do what\u2019s right. I appreciate it!\nEdit 2: just wanted everyone to know that I\u2019ve called and made a report. The case agent is supposed to head out there today.

My wife and I have been together for 10 years and it hasn't always been smooth.  Over a year into our relationship, my depression got really bad and I broke up with her. We never really cut much contact, and I still saw her often, but I was in a bad place.  She ended up dating a guy she worked with during the summer for a month or so, and we stayed in contact the whole time.  I told her I wanted her back, and she said she broke up with the guy. We were leaving for college together that fall.  The day before we left I found out they never broke up at all.  \n\n\nDrama drama drama, we still go to school together and talk it out. We get back together. I had my suspicions that they were still together, but I really wanted to be with her. About 2 weeks into the semester, I was at her dorm and saw a weird stain on the sheets.  She kept dodging the question about what it was, and then finally said she had spilled some cheese out of her lunch and didn't change the sheets afterward.  I also found an open pack of condoms, but she claimed her mother had given them to her (very likely) and a floor mate needed one. I'm still not sure when she and the guy actually broke up.  \n\n\nThe next semester, a mutual friend was reminiscing about the Homecoming game, and let it slip that my wife had been there with her boyfriend when she had told me she returned home that weekend and hadn't answered her phone at all.  We worked through that though, because I had already known she was with him at the beginning of the semester.  It wasn't until YEARS later, when my wife was pregnant with our child, that she finally admitted that yes, it was in fact, cum on the bed sheets.  Obviously, I got upset, but what could I do at that point? She was having a baby we made together, and we had already been \\*married\\* for 3 years.  \n\n\nLately, I've felt less secure and passionate in our relationship.  Nothing else really has happened that I know of, and this change is all on me.  If anything, my wife loves me more now than she ever has, but I just don't feel the same anymore.  I always wanted someone to \\*choose\\* me, if that makes sense.  I feel like she settled for me in the end, when I only ever wanted her.  We haven't had sex in nearly a month because I just.. can't feel intimate that way with her.  I keep thinking about all the lies toward the beginning of our relationship... I feel manipulated into having this life.  But.. it's been years, and I don't think it would be right to leave now.  We have two kids, we're trying to buy a house, I'm a stay-at-home-mom with no income of my own.  If I did leave, I'd have no where to go.  \n\n\nI hate my life. I love my kids, but they are the only thing about my life that I enjoy. What can I do? Should we try counseling? If I bring all this up... how will she react? Am I being petty for feeling this way only now? I'm normally a very passionate person.  My mom always joked that I have a soapbox in my back pocket, because I can never just have an opinion. I take a stand. I have always showered my wife with love and tenderness, but lately it's been a struggle just to cuddle with her.  She knows somethings wrong.  She can feel I'm pulling away, and she is getting angry and sad.  I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm destroying our marriage over ancient history\n\nEdit:: even though I found out about her lies about 3 years ago, these feelings are resurfacing now because we recently got into an ugly fight when she accused me of cheating. I have never cheated, and she reacted so hostility over absolutely nothing, part of me feels a bit indignant about it.  After the accusation, I started to pull away.

My wife and I have been together for 10 years and it hasn&#39;t always been smooth.  Over a year into our relationship, my depression got really bad and I broke up with her. We never really cut much contact, and I still saw her often, but I was in a bad place.  She ended up dating a guy she worked with during the summer for a month or so, and we stayed in contact the whole time.  I told her I wanted her back, and she said she broke up with the guy. We were leaving for college together that fall.  The day before we left I found out they never broke up at all.  </p>\n\n<p>Drama drama drama, we still go to school together and talk it out. We get back together. I had my suspicions that they were still together, but I really wanted to be with her. About 2 weeks into the semester, I was at her dorm and saw a weird stain on the sheets.  She kept dodging the question about what it was, and then finally said she had spilled some cheese out of her lunch and didn&#39;t change the sheets afterward.  I also found an open pack of condoms, but she claimed her mother had given them to her (very likely) and a floor mate needed one. I&#39;m still not sure when she and the guy actually broke up.  </p>\n\n<p>The next semester, a mutual friend was reminiscing about the Homecoming game, and let it slip that my wife had been there with her boyfriend when she had told me she returned home that weekend and hadn&#39;t answered her phone at all.  We worked through that though, because I had already known she was with him at the beginning of the semester.  It wasn&#39;t until YEARS later, when my wife was pregnant with our child, that she finally admitted that yes, it was in fact, cum on the bed sheets.  Obviously, I got upset, but what could I do at that point? She was having a baby we made together, and we had already been *married* for 3 years.  </p>\n\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve felt less secure and passionate in our relationship.  Nothing else really has happened that I know of, and this change is all on me.  If anything, my wife loves me more now than she ever has, but I just don&#39;t feel the same anymore.  I always wanted someone to *choose* me, if that makes sense.  I feel like she settled for me in the end, when I only ever wanted her.  We haven&#39;t had sex in nearly a month because I just.. can&#39;t feel intimate that way with her.  I keep thinking about all the lies toward the beginning of our relationship... I feel manipulated into having this life.  But.. it&#39;s been years, and I don&#39;t think it would be right to leave now.  We have two kids, we&#39;re trying to buy a house, I&#39;m a stay-at-home-mom with no income of my own.  If I did leave, I&#39;d have no where to go.  </p>\n\n<p>I hate my life. I love my kids, but they are the only thing about my life that I enjoy. What can I do? Should we try counseling? If I bring all this up... how will she react? Am I being petty for feeling this way only now? I&#39;m normally a very passionate person.  My mom always joked that I have a soapbox in my back pocket, because I can never just have an opinion. I take a stand. I have always showered my wife with love and tenderness, but lately it&#39;s been a struggle just to cuddle with her.  She knows somethings wrong.  She can feel I&#39;m pulling away, and she is getting angry and sad.  I don&#39;t know what to do. I feel like I&#39;m destroying our marriage over ancient history</p>\n\n<p>Edit:: even though I found out about her lies about 3 years ago, these feelings are resurfacing now because we recently got into an ugly fight when she accused me of cheating. I have never cheated, and she reacted so hostility over absolutely nothing, part of me feels a bit indignant about it.  After the accusation, I started to pull away.  I never treated her that badly even when she DID cheat on me, so it makes me feel like I&#39;m held to a significantly higher standard for loving her than she has for herself when it comes to loving me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "gj0lyl", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jhammi", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 65, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj0lyl/me_27f_and_me_wife_27_did_i_make_a_huge_mistake/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj0lyl/me_27f_and_me_wife_27_did_i_make_a_huge_mistake/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3053778, "created_utc": 1589381802.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "selftext": "Hi everyone.

Do I just take the L and continue using condoms for the rest of my marriage or are there other potential compromises? </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Wife on the pill won&#39;t let me hit it raw.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "gj5cmz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SecretCIA", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 198, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj5cmz/my_25m_wife_25f_refuses_to_have_sex_without_a/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj5cmz/my_25m_wife_25f_refuses_to_have_sex_without_a/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3053778, "created_utc": 1589396624.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "selftext": "Guys, I'm in trouble.

I definitely might be watching too much Criminal Minds in quarantine haha!\n\nImportant background:\n\n\\- I went to a small high school with about 90 people per grade. It was the kind of school where everyone knew each other - or at least knew OF each other - and you could name everyone five grades below and above you. This guy in question, let's call him Donald Davidson, was in the grade above me. Despite being at this very small school, I never ever ever spoke to Donald Davidson. I don't think we've had a single conversation. The only time we were ever in the same room was for concerts for the school jazz/pop ensemble that he was in because my high school (now ex)boyfriend was in the ensemble with him. Even then, we had absolutely no interaction. Of course, there were always silly rumors in a school this small like \"Bob has a crush on you!\" or \"John thinks you're cute!\" But I never heard any of that kind of thing about me, especially not concerning him.\n\n\\- I'm in an industry that puts a lot of value on social media following. As such, I can not go private (although I've recently asked my agent if she'd be willing to reconsider this).\n\nOkay, now the matter at hand:\n\nMaybe about a year ago, I was checking through my Instagram story viewers and noticed that Donald viewed my story. I decided to click his profile and realized that not only was I not following him, he wasn't following me either. Because of the fact that we really had never spoken ever, I kind of just moved on with my day, didn't follow him, and shrugged it off. I started noticing that he was looking at my Instagram stories every day from that moment on, despite him not following me, but again, didn't really think much of it.\n\nI mentioned this offhandedly to my best friend, who is dating someone who was in Donald's grade, and they both expressed concern. My best friend's boyfriend warned me that he was a very strange guy but I just sort of ignored it and decided that Donald was a bored guy on social media who happened to like looking at my stories.\n\nFor some reason, a little while after this conversation, about a week ago, I felt a little weird about the whole thing and decided to block him. A few hours later, I checked my views again and saw that a new account, with no profile picture and not following anyone or with any followers called \"DonDay\" had viewed the story. I instantly knew who it was and blocked this new account. The next day? A viewer called \"DayDon.\" As I went to block this account, the name combination revived a memory. A few months ago, I got a Snapchat friend request from someone with the name \"DayDon,\" who had no snap score and no image. I didn't recognize the name at the time, thought that the 0 score was weird, and declined the request.\n\nThis incited a few other memories that are now the REAL cause for my concern, strange social media stuff aside. About a year ago, I posted on my Instagram story that my brother was having a dance concert and encouraged people to come out and support him. I tagged the dance studio's location, which is two cities away, about an hour from where I live and an hour and a half from where I went to high school. When I got to the dance concert, I recognized Donald in the Panera next to the dance studio. I shrugged it off and thought maybe he just lived in this other city. (Note: there are TONS of Paneras in our area. You wouldn't have to go to this city to go to a Panera).\n\nNow the nail in the coffin: a few months later, I saw Donald sitting on a bench at the pond right outside of my house. I had forgotten the Panera incident and assumed that he just lived in my neighborhood. I saw him again on that bench another two times, as recently as five weeks ago. When all of these memories came flooding back, I asked my brother (who is still in high school and in the same grade as Donald's sister) to open the school directory. I looked up Donald's address and sure enough, he lives about 30 minutes from me and 2 hours away from the dance studio city. There was seemingly no reason for him to be outside of my house three times\n\nI'm definitely quite freaked out. He's never approached me, never actually said a word to me. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this or if this is actually as concerning as it feels. Another friend brought up maybe reaching out to him and asking what's going on, but I don't know that that's a smart move. Am I nuts and is this nothing? Or is there something I should do?\n\nI haven't told my boyfriend about this because I don't want to worry him for no reason. Only my friend, her boyfriend, and another friend of mine who was also in the ensemble with Donald know. That other friend is the one who suggested reaching out. They all think none of this is coincidental.\n\nThanks so much for any advice!!!!", "author_fullname": "t2_5kmlnvnj", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I (21F) Am Afraid I Have a Stalker (22M)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_gjfbni", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589459490.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I posted this yesterday but deleted it, given the nature of this whole thing, once I realized it wasn&#39;t on my throwaway!
