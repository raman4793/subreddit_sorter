Also, the hospital will hunt me down like a vampire if I don\u2019t.\n\nSince my family doesn\u2019t have any surgical masks, my justifiably paranoid dad came up with a plan which involved wearing the ridiculous full-face shield ([https://imgur.com/gallery/3KMp2Sp](https://imgur.com/gallery/3KMp2Sp)) to the hospital.\n\nAfter being trained to maximum readiness by the United States Department of Dad (U.S.D.D.) on proper mask donning protocol, I was cleared for the baby-blood mission. I\u2019d like to tell you that it was all about the preemies, but I desperately wanted social interaction I and was willing to suffer the humiliation of wearing a fishbowl to get it\u2026even if it meant getting stabbed. I promised the U.S.D.D. that I would secure the plastic suction cup to my face at all times while in public.\n\nI felt goofy checking in wearing the alien mask, but no biggie. Nope, they can\u2019t stick me in the corner. That\u2019d be too discrete. Instead, they planted me across the aisle from Handsome, who is wearing a regular mask like a normal human. Even though I can\u2019t see his mouth, I can tell he\u2019s laughing at me from the way the skin crinkled around his eyes.\n\nI couldn\u2019t let him get away with that, so I wagged my finger at him and dropped my voice an octave, planning for it to come out all Darth Vadery from the filters when I teasingly said, \u201cIt\u2019s never wise to mock a woman\u2019s accessories.\u201d There are precisely zero James Earl Jones qualities that erupted from those filters. All they did was vibrate and squeak.\n\nMost of the time, the nurses at the hospital are snipers and hit blood on the first try. But they were understandably short-staffed, and I got Tina, the nursing student. I have rolling veins with the factory setting for evasive maneuvers. So, it\u2019s Tina vs. my rolling veins, and my veins kicked her ass. Tina wouldn\u2019t have stabbed me more times if I had been a voodoo doll of her cheating ex.\n\nNeedles don\u2019t freak me out. Still, I started to sweat through my sundress.\n\nThen Tina had to try the other arm, and my hair becomes congealed with moisture to the back of my neck and shoulders. Seriously, my bare shoulders were sweating. Finally, Tina hit the jackpot.\n\nMy heart was thudding as if I was jogging. I dropped my head back, closed my eyes, and resolved to just bleed like a champ while I tried to slow my racing pulse. I DID NOT feel good. My stomach lurched, and the face shield made it impossible to breathe.\n\nThe tickle in my throat turned into a cough. No one wants to hear a cough in public these days, but it sure as shit got their attention in time for them all to see me jerk off the mask I promised to wear to gasp. An anaconda was squeezing my ribs. All of the people in the room started to swirl and vanish into vapor, including Handsome.\n\nAfter much commotion, a shot of epinephrine, and many drags of O2, a doctor eventually decide that I could leave the hospital. The allergist suspected the mask, or chemicals that could be in the mask filters, but couldn\u2019t be sure.\n\nHandsome offered to drive me home, but it was too soon for any new adventures. He did sit outside in the grass with my disheveled butt until I was okay to drive. He snagged copious amounts of cookies and juice for me, so technically, I considered it a date. That is until I got a look at my face in the rearview mirror once in my car. My face had ballooned like I \u2018d gone \u00bd a round with Connor Mcgregor.\n\nI still have to go through allergy testing, but I think I\u2019ve connected the dots on what happened. My dad had been wearing the mask while making latex molds. I\u2019ve also had another, um, reaction to latex that that was not so severe, and I didn\u2019t put it together until now. I\u2019m not sharing that experience with the U.S.D.D., so shhh. Latex is likely the problem.\n\nToday, I\u2019m feeling better. Babies got blood. Tina got to practice with rolling veins, even if I look like I shoot heroin. I connected with Handsome\u2014he\u2019s checked in a few times, but they're likely pity follow-ups. Doesn\u2019t matter; he still gets points.  I am planning a hazing assault on U.S.D.D. even though I technically failed the DefCon 2 training, but have to wait a few days to let him get over the feeling that he sucks as the family safety officer. Meanwhile, I\u2019m self- quarantining away from my family (argh) because I inhaled into my lung every molecule of air in the hospital.  I\u2019ll pass the time by making up wildly inappropriate stories to explain my face as I snap with friends. While I do not recommend anaphylaxis, 12/10 the hospital is the place to do it.\n\nTL;DR I wore a face mask that had residual latex on it without knowing that I might have a latex allergy. Cue anaphylactic reaction.\n\nEdit: Getting a lot of requests for an update. Apparently Handsome is not easily scared off. I have a date tomorrow night with him for a social distance approved walk and picnic. Starting to think it might have all been worth it. He\u2019s also funny and flirty on top of being a great guy.

I tell the doctor everything that I have going on and he thinks I have meningitis. \n      Now the fun thing about meningitis is that in order to test for it you have to do a spinal tap.

I\u2019m listening and auto bobbing my head like yeah yeah sure whatever. This was the exact moment I fucked up. \n      See what I didn\u2019t know is that when you get a spinal tap there is a scab that forms that prevents cerebral spinal fluid from leaking into your body.

Feeling like an idiot with no idea why my North Korea conducted their latest nuclear test inside my skull. I explain to the doctor everything including being in the ER a few days ago. He starts laughing. Yeah real funny doc. He tells me I\u2019m an idiot but it\u2019s an easy fix. He tells me I\u2019m not gonna like it. \n      He comes in with the biggest needle I have ever seen. Like I\u2019m wondering if I ended up at a horse veterinarian. Is that big. The syringe holds a pint. If you have ever spent any time in shitty night clubs just imagine the syringe that the girls walk around with filled with Jell-O shots. I ask what he is gonna do but honestly I\u2019m in so much pain I\u2019m just hoping he kills me with it. He tells me they are going to fill that syringe with blood from my arm and insert it into my back. Ok. \n      Before we start they call for a special nurse.

It was a great summer, I was 14 and hormones were raging. We lived in an apartment building where my dad was the janitor. All I could think of back then was girls girls girls and where could I dry hump the next one. A buddy of mine and I would hang out at a local skating rink, every day there was an hour of free skating from 3-4 and we were there to flirt with the girls. We met these two Polish girls, Anka and Ana. We would meet almost every day and talk to them. We needed a makeout place so we chose to invite them over to my house on Saturday evening while my parents were away. Fast forward after a few successful weekends of making out and dry humping and getting to second base and we were hooked. So here's the fuck up. In my fucked up hormonal teenage mind I wanted more. So I came up with a plan that I would drill a hole, a tiny hole, in my bedroom wall which was adjacent to the bathroom. I figured I would use my dad's drill and the smallest bit to make a tiny hole that would allow me to see inside the bathroom while the girls were using it so I I could see something. Saturday comes around and my parents go for groceries every Saturday around 2, they come back around 4 we have dinner then they leave around 6 the girls comes over and I get to take a peak. The plan is perfect. My parents leave and I have everything ready. I pick a spot, I measured the wall in the bathroom and my wall so that I know where the hole will come out on the other side. I would get a full view of their ass and it would be glorious. I drill and it goes in the first part very easily, but then I hit something hard and while this is not planned I figure, no worries it's one of those pieces of wood they space out every 4 feet or something. It's much harder than the first part so I need to crack this baby up. The next part of drilling sounds weird, sounds like metal but I say to myself, am I that unlucky that I must have hit a nail. I then proceed to reverse the drill because its just not turning so maybe I need a new spot. As soon as I take the drill out a jet of water just starts shooting at me and it didn't take long before I realized it was hot water. I panic and go in the bathroom and get a towel but I know this won't fix it but WTF do I do?!? 5 minutes later from holding the towel and I can feel the pressure is not the same.

It was a great summer, I was 14 and hormones were raging. We lived in an apartment building where my dad was the janitor. All I could think of back then was girls girls girls and where could I dry hump the next one. A buddy of mine and I would hang out at a local skating rink, every day there was an hour of free skating from 3-4 and we were there to flirt with the girls. We met these two Polish girls, Anka and Ana. We would meet almost every day and talk to them. We needed a makeout place so we chose to invite them over to my house on Saturday evening while my parents were away. Fast forward after a few successful weekends of making out and dry humping and getting to second base and we were hooked. So here&#39;s the fuck up. In my fucked up hormonal teenage mind I wanted more. So I came up with a plan that I would drill a hole, a tiny hole, in my bedroom wall which was adjacent to the bathroom. I figured I would use my dad&#39;s drill and the smallest bit to make a tiny hole that would allow me to see inside the bathroom while the girls were using it so I I could see something. Saturday comes around and my parents go for groceries every Saturday around 2, they come back around 4 we have dinner then they leave around 6 the girls comes over and I get to take a peak. The plan is perfect. My parents leave and I have everything ready. I pick a spot, I measured the wall in the bathroom and my wall so that I know where the hole will come out on the other side. I would get a full view of their ass and it would be glorious. I drill and it goes in the first part very easily, but then I hit something hard and while this is not planned I figure, no worries it&#39;s one of those pieces of wood they space out every 4 feet or something. It&#39;s much harder than the first part so I need to crack this baby up. The next part of drilling sounds weird, sounds like metal but I say to myself, am I that unlucky that I must have hit a nail. I then proceed to reverse the drill because its just not turning so maybe I need a new spot. As soon as I take the drill out a jet of water just starts shooting at me and it didn&#39;t take long before I realized it was hot water. I panic and go in the bathroom and get a towel but I know this won&#39;t fix it but WTF do I do?!? 5 minutes later from holding the towel and I can feel the pressure is not the same. Almost no water is coming through, is it over? I then hear the door bell and I panic again. I go and it&#39;s the upstairs neighbor, he says there&#39;s no hot water and he needs to talk to my dad. I let him know that I will let him know as soon as he comes home. Not long after my dad comes home and I think he will kill me. I straight away tell him that I was trying to drill a hole in my room in order to &quot;hang a picture&quot; (the hole was behind my door, who hangs a picture behind a door?) To this day I&#39;ll never forget my dad&#39;s reaction. He was not one for bullshit and I thought he would see right through me.

He is 14 so I do trust him to do the steps on prepared foods - like anything that\u2019s in the pantry is something he is welcome to use and I trust him. Well today he asked if he could have spaghetti os since we had some in the pantry but usually don\u2019t so he wanted to check with me (the selection at the store is a bit limited in the canned food aisle). I explained that they weren\u2019t for anything special and he could have them. About 10 minutes later it\u2019s like that meme \u2014 alarms are going off, children are screaming; thankfully no glass is breaking. I step away from my work and find my son, who is panicking in the kitchen trying to turn off the smoke alarm. My eyes go straight to the microwave. I see sparks and a sinking feeling comes over me. He put the can in the microwave. I unplugged the microwave and grabbed the fire extinguisher in case. After tossing the can with the help of some grill tongs, and opening the windows and taking a breather of fresh air, I grab my son and some granola bars. I can\u2019t be mad at him. When would he have learned that metal doesn\u2019t go in the microwave? I didn\u2019t teach him. I know he is sorry for the mess and chaos. We have a talk but it is awkward. I know there are other things I never told him. I am now going through discussion forums trying to find what I, like the parents of some on TIFU, failed to teach my son.

But today marks the consequence of a long chain of fuck ups I am responsible for.</p>\n\n<p>The day is going well, we are up and my son is getting himself something to eat for lunch as we are at home and I haven\u2019t had the time to make meals for us. He is 14 so I do trust him to do the steps on prepared foods - like anything that\u2019s in the pantry is something he is welcome to use and I trust him. Well today he asked if he could have spaghetti os since we had some in the pantry but usually don\u2019t so he wanted to check with me (the selection at the store is a bit limited in the canned food aisle). I explained that they weren\u2019t for anything special and he could have them. About 10 minutes later it\u2019s like that meme \u2014 alarms are going off, children are screaming; thankfully no glass is breaking. I step away from my work and find my son, who is panicking in the kitchen trying to turn off the smoke alarm. My eyes go straight to the microwave. I see sparks and a sinking feeling comes over me. He put the can in the microwave. I unplugged the microwave and grabbed the fire extinguisher in case. After tossing the can with the help of some grill tongs, and opening the windows and taking a breather of fresh air, I grab my son and some granola bars. I can\u2019t be mad at him. When would he have learned that metal doesn\u2019t go in the microwave? I didn\u2019t teach him. I know he is sorry for the mess and chaos. We have a talk but it is awkward. I know there are other things I never told him. I am now going through discussion forums trying to find what I, like the parents of some on TIFU, failed to teach my son. So far, I have gathered that I never taught him how to clean below the belly button, nor how to use safety equipment like an extinguisher or to do the heimlick, not did I teach him how to safely handle meat and fish, nor how to do laundry.

And for the record, yes, I am completely incapable of making a good decision, so settle in for a long one.\n\nI had just finished up work on my laptop for the day and was bored, so I went to the mailroom to go collect a package. I had gotten a vr headset to use with a new drone I had bought a few weeks back out of desperate need for something to do in quarantine and was raring to show it off to my girlfriend.\n\nI start setting up the drone and notice that the battery of the drone displays 2 out of 5 and I think to myself that I'll make it a quick flight just for a demonstration and then charge it. I get the VR and drone ready, turn on the drone in the living room to test it, ask the GF to put the headset on, take the drone out to the 2nd story patio and I make the drone shoot up above the apartment.\n\n\"Woooaaahhh, that's so cool! I can see the restaurant across the street!\"\n\nShe's loving it! I'll fly it around a little bit like I've done dozens of times before and try the VR headset myself. But something's wrong... The drone is drifting towards the roof. I try to control it the other direction but it's gone rogue. I glance  at the battery level on my controller and the drone's battery had dropped to 0 out of five. It was now in \"Return Home\" mode and since I had initially turned it on inside it decided to land right above that; the roof, where it landed on it's side, unable to move.\n\nShit.\n\nSo I talked to GF about the situation, trying to figure out what to do. We went outside and saw it on the opposite side of the roof, over the hump. We could contact the apartment main office and ask if someone could somehow retrieve it, but we decided they would 1) be annoyed, and 2) probably wouldn't get around to it for a while (plus we have rain on the forecast), so I decided to try something a bit more eccentric. Drive a big remote control car on the roof with a rope trailing behind. My thought process was that I could drive around the drone to hook it and then reel  them both in with the string. Wanna guess how that went? Pretty well actually.... right up until the RC car sputtered to a halt. I forgot to charge it's battery too. \n\nFUCK. ME.\n\nAlright, so by this point a myriad of bad decisions have been made. I am a fool. So, what does a reasonable person do, now that they're looking a $300 loss in the face? Do they call it a loss? Do they suck up their pride and go to the office for help? Probably. Well that's not what I did. I decided to wait until it was dark and climb up on top of the roof to get them myself.\n\n-_-\n\nSO, after a few minutes of trying to muster up the courage, I hobble up on to the railing and slowly lift myself up on to the edge of the roof like the fat ninja I am. This is where I start to panic. There isn't much below me at this point besides the railing and a now 3 story drop. All I can do is palm the roof tiles as hard as I can and use every last drop of strength I have to drag my sack of lard body, belly first, fully up onto the roof, trying not to fall backwards from the sheer might that is gravity.\n\n\"When did I get so fat???\"\n\nDrained from my initial success I lay there motionlessness. A dark blob on the roof to anyone who might happen a glance my direction. After a minute to compose myself I started to crawl. I just had to get over the hump of the roof and I'd be able to see the RC's. Still on my belly I dragged myself up, inch by inch, too afraid to lift myself up due to the steep angle of the roof. Every second lasted an eternity. After what felt like an hour I reached the top and was in reaching distance of the rogue toys, but I just sat there a beat to rest before my return home. In that moment I thought about many things. When will quarantine end? Why do the tops of buildings always look so bland? How did I end up on the roof? All questions for later. \n\nI spun around onto my butt, grabbed the vehicles, and began scooting ass first down the roof, stopping every scoot to place the toys further down so I could grip the roof tiles better. It was only when I got to the bottom of the roof when I realized my one fatal flaw.\n\nHOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO GET DOWN?!?\n\nThe simple answer? I wasn't supposed to. I am an foolish foolish man person and I was now stuck on the roof. 5 minutes pass and I still can't think of anything. I resort to one of my last lifelines; My wonderful amazing GF. I get my phone out and call her and ask her to come outside. Like the savior she is, she rushed outside and quickly started helping me brainstorm. We ended up deciding on me climbing down the wall that divides me and my neighbor while she holds me against it as best she can, and somehow, miraculously even, I'm able to shimmy down the wall, but not before I see a shape move by in their window.\n\nPretty sure they saw me, and also pretty sure our first time meeting will be one to remember. But that's a problem for tomorrow's me.\n\nAnyways, that's how my day went. This took me a long time to write, so I feel much more calm now, but some lessons were definitely learned throughout this experience. \n\nTl;Dr:.

I glance  at the battery level on my controller and the drone&#39;s battery had dropped to 0 out of five. It was now in &quot;Return Home&quot; mode and since I had initially turned it on inside it decided to land right above that; the roof, where it landed on it&#39;s side, unable to move.</p>\n\n<p>Shit.</p>\n\n<p>So I talked to GF about the situation, trying to figure out what to do. We went outside and saw it on the opposite side of the roof, over the hump. We could contact the apartment main office and ask if someone could somehow retrieve it, but we decided they would 1) be annoyed, and 2) probably wouldn&#39;t get around to it for a while (plus we have rain on the forecast), so I decided to try something a bit more eccentric. Drive a big remote control car on the roof with a rope trailing behind. My thought process was that I could drive around the drone to hook it and then reel  them both in with the string. Wanna guess how that went? Pretty well actually.... right up until the RC car sputtered to a halt. I forgot to charge it&#39;s battery too. </p>\n\n<p>FUCK. ME.</p>\n\n<p>Alright, so by this point a myriad of bad decisions have been made. I am a fool. So, what does a reasonable person do, now that they&#39;re looking a $300 loss in the face? Do they call it a loss? Do they suck up their pride and go to the office for help? Probably. Well that&#39;s not what I did. I decided to wait until it was dark and climb up on top of the roof to get them myself.</p>\n\n<p>-_-</p>\n\n<p>SO, after a few minutes of trying to muster up the courage, I hobble up on to the railing and slowly lift myself up on to the edge of the roof like the fat ninja I am. This is where I start to panic. There isn&#39;t much below me at this point besides the railing and a now 3 story drop. All I can do is palm the roof tiles as hard as I can and use every last drop of strength I have to drag my sack of lard body, belly first, fully up onto the roof, trying not to fall backwards from the sheer might that is gravity.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When did I get so fat???&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Drained from my initial success I lay there motionlessness. A dark blob on the roof to anyone who might happen a glance my direction. After a minute to compose myself I started to crawl. I just had to get over the hump of the roof and I&#39;d be able to see the RC&#39;s. Still on my belly I dragged myself up, inch by inch, too afraid to lift myself up due to the steep angle of the roof. Every second lasted an eternity. After what felt like an hour I reached the top and was in reaching distance of the rogue toys, but I just sat there a beat to rest before my return home. In that moment I thought about many things. When will quarantine end? Why do the tops of buildings always look so bland? How did I end up on the roof? All questions for later. </p>\n\n<p>I spun around onto my butt, grabbed the vehicles, and began scooting ass first down the roof, stopping every scoot to place the toys further down so I could grip the roof tiles better. It was only when I got to the bottom of the roof when I realized my one fatal flaw.</p>\n\n<p>HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO GET DOWN?!?</p>\n\n<p>The simple answer? I wasn&#39;t supposed to. I am an foolish foolish man person and I was now stuck on the roof. 5 minutes pass and I still can&#39;t think of anything. I resort to one of my last lifelines; My wonderful amazing GF. I get my phone out and call her and ask her to come outside. Like the savior she is, she rushed outside and quickly started helping me brainstorm. We ended up deciding on me climbing down the wall that divides me and my neighbor while she holds me against it as best she can, and somehow, miraculously even, I&#39;m able to shimmy down the wall, but not before I see a shape move by in their window.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty sure they saw me, and also pretty sure our first time meeting will be one to remember. But that&#39;s a problem for tomorrow&#39;s me.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, that&#39;s how my day went. This took me a long time to write, so I feel much more calm now, but some lessons were definitely learned throughout this experience. </p>\n\n<p>Tl;Dr:. I stranded my drone on the roof of my apartment, stranded an RC car trying to retrieve it, and then nearly got stuck on/fell off of the roof after realizing how much weight I&#39;ve gained during quarantine.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "497f429e-fe53-11e4-b824-0e87a9ce7ca1", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2to41", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#fd7f09", "id": "gjhglf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThePelicanThatCould", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/tifu/comments/gjhglf/tifu_by_not_charging_my_drone/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gjhglf/tifu_by_not_charging_my_drone/", "subreddit_subscribers": 15530274, "created_utc": 1589440670.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "tifu", "selftext": "Eating too many mcnuggiez\n\nSo this actually happened today.

So that was extremely awkward. </p>\n\n<p>I kept listening hoping it would explain the context and praying my neighbor wouldn\u2019t go inside before then, but I was too afraid to make eye contact to know if that happened!!! </p>\n\n<p>Would you have kept listening?</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR While listening to my audiobook in my backyard, a very racist part happened to come on while my black neighbor was outside.

During a trip to the grocery store, I found and bought a pomegranate - a fruit I had heard about, but had never tried. It was cool, unique, exotic, and somewhat inviting. This was a time before pomegranates became superfruits and you could buy Pom juice at the local convenience store.\n\nKnowing nothing about what to do with a pomegranate, I cut it up into 4 or so pieces and threw it into my blender - skin, pith, and seeds. I blended it until smooth and it smelled and looked fantastic. Thinking I had hit smoothie gold, I poured it into a large cup over some ice and started drinking it. It was like nothing I had ever tasted. Sure, it had some similarity to tart cherries and raspberries, but it was sweet and refreshing. It was perfect.\n\nLittle did I know that I was about to go on a physiological rollercoaster because I had eaten, no chugged, the skin and pith of a pomegranate.\n\nAbout 5 minutes in, I started to feel warm and my heart started racing. I stared in disbelief at my empty cup and wondered if I had done something wrong. A minute or two later, I felt like I had a fever and began sweating profusely. I mean, the sweat was pouring from my head and around my ears like I had gone for a jog. Remember, this was in 2004 - before smart phones and Google searches at your fingertips.

I was so focused to get this dildo under my throat so I got a little jumpscare from that noise and I turned around as soon as possible to check what's happening.
