He could claim it never happened or he could even claim I consented to him borrowing the money. How could you prove it?\n\n\n\nSomeone reports their car stolen from a bad neighborhood, wheres the evidence they didnt intentionally leave it vulnerable for the insurance claim? Or do you only have their word? Let's say you find the car and the only physical evidence in the car is from the owner, is that proof the owner was involved in the 'theft' or maybe just proof that the thief was just really careful? \n\n\n\nThe why actually has to do with this, imo\n\n>Did she say \"fuck me\" or not? A 1/2 second worth of words is enough to send a man to prison or not. \n\nIt makes quite a few assumptions about sexual assault that are way too common and just not true.\n\n1. That the victims are always women and the perpetrators are always men. [This is completely inaccurate and does a real disservice to male rape victims, especially if it's a teenage boy and adult woman (since hegemonic masculinity tells you that's a good thing and the kid is a stud/player/etc)]\n2. It says consent is as simple as \"a 1/2 second worth of words\" but consent is more than just 'do you wanna fuck?' 'Yeah fuck me'. Consent is given not just with words but body language too (hint if your partner is staring out a window or at a wall not moving or speaking, they didnt consent to what you think they did). Consent is not just about sex either, you consent to people borrowing your money/things, you consent to medical treatments, consent to be involved in research, I could go on.\n3. That being accused results in going to jail. Obviously an accusation should not ever be enough to jail someone, we all deserve a fair trial but when only 6 out of every 1000 rape accusations result in even a day of jail time, when studies show only 2-6% of rape accusations are false, we have a HUGE problem and rather than hyper-focusing on those few false accusations (which our justice system typically eventually finds innocent) we should be focusing on how to get the approximate 934 rapists per 1000 accusations to actually be held accountable  for their actions.
