readers work. But I try.\n\nAbout how the screen reader knows what to read, generally we tell it what to read. There are keyboard or touchscreen commands that we use to focus on the part of the screen we want to read. To make explaining this easier let's limit it to how we use Reddit.\n\nI usually use the Reddit website on my Windows PC using Google Chrome. When the website opens, I can use up and down arrows to read the page line by line from top to bottom. It's not a very quick way to use a website though. So the screen reader have provided command keys to help us jump from element to element. For example, titles on Reddit are headings, so to quickly move to and read the next heading and thus, next post, I press letter h. To jump to the previous heading I use shift + h. If I like the title, I use the down arrow to enter the body of the post and read it line by line by pressing it once for each line. If I don't want to read the text line by line I can use ctrl + up or down arrow to read the post text paragraph by paragraph. Similar key commands to h are available for other elements (like u for unvisited links, v for visited links, b for buttons, e for edit boxes, etc.)\n\nWhen we move on a particular element either with arrow keys or key commands, the screen reader announces the type of the element after reading it's name. For example, when I finish reading the post text, if I arrow down or press b (for button), the screen reader says \"Upvote toggle button not pressed\" here I can press space bar (usually acts like one left click) to upvote the post. Now that I have upvoted, if I move to the upvote button again it reads \"Upvote toggle button pressed\".\n\nNative applications are a bit different, mostly we use tab and shift + tab and arrows to move between elements in the application, enter a double click and space bar to single click.\n\nFinally, about visualizing the screen, in touchscreen environments like on a smart phone it's possible, but on devices we operate using keyboard the presentation is mostly linear (items seem to be next to each other in a sequence).\n\nSorry for the poor English and long-winded comment.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s hard to explain how screen readers work.

Staying alive is literally the bare minimum I can do, nothing brave about it.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gj3mxg/telling_disabled_people_theyre_fighters_or_brave/fqk0mzg/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqk0mzg", "created": 1589446926.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589418126.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unpopularopinion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj3mxg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqk1ya0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "baldonebighead", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gj3mxg", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_1fubgwjq", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0s", "body": "Like they're even understand it", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Like they&#39;re even understand it</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gj3mxg/telling_disabled_people_theyre_fighters_or_brave/fqk1ya0/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqk1ya0", "created": 1589447575.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589418775.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unpopularopinion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj3mxg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqkcprv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "total_insertion", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gj3mxg", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_40fja0w0", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0s", "body": "Not if you deck them first", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Not if you deck them first</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gj3mxg/telling_disabled_people_theyre_fighters_or_brave/fqkcprv/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqkcprv", "created": 1589453384.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589424584.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unpopularopinion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
