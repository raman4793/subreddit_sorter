Talking specifically about addiction survivors; I feel as though a big part of the reason we \u2018praise\u2019 the recoverers is because some people are more genetically-prone to addiction and therefore have overcome something that some would have an easier time getting past, or maybe not get addicted at all. For example, native Americans are more prone to addiction by genetics, so I\u2019d see a broke native guy getting over a cocaine addiction more worthy of praise, than some white party girl getting over coke. This backed up by the fact that not everyone has the resources that other privileged people might. That white girls parents put her in a supportive therapy group, but that native guy detoxed by handcuffing himself to his basement banister. Just shit to think about. People have different struggles and the praise deserved for getting over an addiction it\u2019s all relative to the person, their genetic make-up, their experiences, and their resources. Of course a white girl could handcuff herself to a banister too, just making a stereotypical example. \n\nI\u2019ve never been one to be into drinking much or doing any hard drugs. I\u2019ve always been a smart person, I made honours every year, I\u2019ve got a great job and have been mostly successful in adulthood despite childhood traumas and parents who struggled with addiction themselves. I\u2019m not \u201cpraised\u201d for it, and I\u2019d be disgusted if I were, just for making it out, while I know damn well there are people out there who deserve praise more than I do. The 3rd world country mothers who carry their children miles to drinkable water every day aren\u2019t on the cover of that paper either. Throughout our lives we\u2019ll be \u201cpraised\u201d in other, more subtle, but maybe more meaningful ways in our lives that often go unnoticed. \n\nThat guy got a page in the paper dedicated to his story, but your family and friends would trust you to watch her kids, would probably loan you money if you were in need, would let you borrow their car, would be there for you, etc. That guy\u2019s friends and family are telling him \u201cgood job!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d \u201cKeep it up!\u201d, \u201cLook, you\u2019re in the paper!\u201d but they\u2019re still building back their respect and trust for him and would probably feel the need to worry that he might sell their car for crack money. He is not being praised. He is receiving positive reinforcement for overcoming his personal struggle. \n\nI sort of see your post a bit like an older sibling getting upset that the younger sibling is getting all the attention cuz they keep fucking up and need that extra attention. Those average Joes who already are doing great don\u2019t often need that positive reinforcement to keep going, because we\u2019re self-sufficient, as we should be. Addicts *do* need that support to help show them that life is better when you\u2019re not dependant on some substance, to help prevent relapse, etc. Think about how fucked someone\u2019s brain can get on drugs. Some of them *are* that little sibling of society that keeps fucking up, and sometimes they do need that extra attention to keep on the straight and narrow. So it is not *all praise*, it\u2019s also necessary extra attention for those who need it.\n\nAlso, why don\u2019t you take a look at every other page in that paper and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see many more stories of praising people doing great things. Sometimes it\u2019s a matter of perspective too. What\u2019s up in your life that you\u2019re feeling you\u2019re lacking praise for, and how can you change that?
