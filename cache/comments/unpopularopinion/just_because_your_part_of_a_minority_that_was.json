At some point the people who live in these communities need to be responsible and accountable for keeping things safe and a good place to live. Carrying guns around doesn't do anything but cause problems. In one year in Chicago alone, there were over 1000 shootings. No amount of money will help that. People in nicer neighborhoods don't shoot guns off all the time, they get mad when people vandalize property, they put garbage in garbage cans. How many times should the government rebuild, reinvest, and clean up a community only to have it destroyed by the people who live there. The parents in that community also need to put a priority on education. Whenever theres a riot (protest) to a cop shooting, you'll see kids at 2-3 in the morning stealing TVs, booze, clothing, ect with mom or dad. Change comes from within, and I haven't seen anyone willing to change their behavior for their community to become better.

At some point the people who live in these communities need to be responsible and accountable for keeping things safe and a good place to live. Carrying guns around doesn&#39;t do anything but cause problems. In one year in Chicago alone, there were over 1000 shootings. No amount of money will help that. People in nicer neighborhoods don&#39;t shoot guns off all the time, they get mad when people vandalize property, they put garbage in garbage cans. How many times should the government rebuild, reinvest, and clean up a community only to have it destroyed by the people who live there. The parents in that community also need to put a priority on education.
