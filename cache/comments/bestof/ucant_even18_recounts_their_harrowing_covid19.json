One neurosurgeon on here said that he was working on a mid 30s stroke victim who came back covid+ and he went to remove the clot with contrast and when he cleared it, instead of it staying clear suddenly like over a dozen clots formed in real time unrelated all over the place in different arteries. It basically shut the patients brain off there were so many. Not all the strains out there are behaving the same either, apparently it had already mutated at least twice before leaving China which is why the west coast mostly has had less serious cases while NY got it imported from the euro strain that hit Italy and Spain. Shit is bad and its not gonna be over any time soon either.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "bestof", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/bestof/comments/gj20fe/ucant_even18_recounts_their_harrowing_covid19/fqlqodo/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqlqodo", "created": 1589493020.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 11, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj20fe", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_fqlkuk7", "id": "fqlkuk7", "parent_id": "t1_fqky4b7", "depth": 3, "children": ["fqlkuk7"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqky4b7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "Bruthal", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589439801.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqkjn95", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_a6u1l", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "body": "Interesting YouTube video on symptoms (warning: contains some photos of organs damaged by Covid-19): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKvIYwqQkE", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Interesting YouTube video on symptoms (warning: contains some photos of organs damaged by Covid-19): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKvIYwqQkE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKvIYwqQkE</a></p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "bestof", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/bestof/comments/gj20fe/ucant_even18_recounts_their_harrowing_covid19/fqky4b7/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqky4b7", "created": 1589468601.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "name": "t1_fql44pz", "id": "fql44pz", "parent_id": "t1_fqkjn95", "depth": 2, "children": ["fql44pz", "fqkxwx3"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqkjn95", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": "Averagebass", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqk7u6g", "score": 142, "author_fullname": "t2_2w551x3l", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "collapsed": false, "body": "Had a patient in the hospital that got it really bad and had to be put on a ventilator.

I might have brought home some new fish the other day, but i had to go to the store for food and medicine for my tank anyway (its not sick, I spilled the bottle over and don't like not having it in stock just in case). I actually feel a lot better today. My tank looks great, the fish are happy and I had my first conversation with another human in person in weeks. She was excited to sell me the fish and we talked about fish, tanks etc from a distance.
