These products can't be reseeded across seasons, a conservation and economic coping technique as old as Mesopotamia. Instead, every year, farmers need to pony up to Cargil, Monsanto and the rest, and purchase that year's crop's seeds in total.\n\n[Seed-saving is an outdated practice](https://www.thefarmersdaughterusa.com/2016/02/no-farmers-dont-want-save-seeds.html), and not doing so is not exclusive to GMO crops. Non-GMOs are also patented, and have been for [almost 100 years](https://patents.google.com/patent/USPP1P/en).\n\nIf farmers want to save their seeds, they can buy a non-patented variety. They are ***volunteering*** to sign these contracts because it's a better product. IF they break patent law, obviously they are going to get sued; as would any other company with any other product if they broke patent law.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There've been numerous cases of these companies' products pollen blowing from a farm using them to a neighboring farm that does not, resulting in the second farm being sued by these Big Agra firms for inadvertently \"stealing\" their genetic patents. They file these suits knowing most farmers lack the resources to fight these legal battles, and will settle. You know, like mobsters do.\n\nNo. Monsanto has never sued anyone for accidental pollination. IF you're going to bring up [Schmeiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc_v_Schmeiser) or [Bowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_v._Monsanto_Co), I suggest reading the Wikipedia articles on the cases first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Another concern is these products \u2013 RoundUp is a good example, but far from the only one \u2013 not only lock in farms to these firms, but like drug dealers, require increasingly more pesticides drenching the fields as the local insect population adapts to RoundUp. More product is required to maintain the same effect. More money, more money, more money, flowing from independent farms to these Agra conglomerates.\n\nRoundUp (Glyphosate) is an herbicide. Not sure what insect resistance has to do with anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Besides which, overuse of these pesticides, and inadequate testing by regulatory-captured departments, are strongly suspected of contributing to the drastically declining bee population. Bees are a requirement for much of the fruits, vegetables and nuts that we have on our dinner table. It's another example how, with many of these large companies, privatizing the profits and socializing the costs is a core part of their business model.\n\nNeonics, maybe. But it could also be due to nutrition, [Varroa destructor mites](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/3515) or Nosema ceranae; or the fact they're being shipped around the country often.

But there are two things wrong with this.\n\n1. That classification system does ***not*** say whether or not something *is*          carcinogenic; it classifies them based on the quality of    evidence.    It    also doesn't base it on how much is needed to be    carcinogenic  or   the    likeliness of you getting cancer, just the    quality of the    evidence. It is not a health risk assessment, it's a  hazard classification.\n2. It does not have to be shown to be carcinogenic in humans to be in 2A. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer):\n\n>\\*\\*Group      2A : The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans.\\*\\*There is  limited     evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient     evidence in     experimental animals. Occasionally, an agent (or  mixture)    may be     classified here when there is inadequate evidence  in humans but     sufficient evidence in experimental animals and  strong evidence that the     carcinogenesis is mediated by a mechanism  that also operates in    humans.   Exceptionally, an agent (or mixture)  may solely be classified    under  this category if there is limited  evidence of carcinogenicity  in   humans,   but if it clearly belongs to  this category based on     mechanistic  considerations.[\\[11\\]](https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/CurrentPreamble.pdf)\n\nOther      things in 2A include red meat, coffee, beverages above 65\u00b0C, and          shiftwork that disrupts circadian rhythm; all things you likely      encounter in ***far*** larger amounts than you do glyphosate.\n\n3.

But there are two things wrong with this.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>That classification system does <strong><em>not</em></strong> say whether or not something <em>is</em>          carcinogenic; it classifies them based on the quality of    evidence.    It    also doesn&#39;t base it on how much is needed to be    carcinogenic  or   the    likeliness of you getting cancer, just the    quality of the    evidence. It is not a health risk assessment, it&#39;s a  hazard classification.</li>\n<li>It does not have to be shown to be carcinogenic in humans to be in 2A. From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer\">Wikipedia</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>**Group      2A : The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans.**There is  limited     evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient     evidence in     experimental animals. Occasionally, an agent (or  mixture)    may be     classified here when there is inadequate evidence  in humans but     sufficient evidence in experimental animals and  strong evidence that the     carcinogenesis is mediated by a mechanism  that also operates in    humans.   Exceptionally, an agent (or mixture)  may solely be classified    under  this category if there is limited  evidence of carcinogenicity  in   humans,   but if it clearly belongs to  this category based on     mechanistic  considerations.<a href=\"https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/CurrentPreamble.pdf\">[11]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other      things in 2A include red meat, coffee, beverages above 65\u00b0C, and          shiftwork that disrupts circadian rhythm; all things you likely      encounter in <strong><em>far</em></strong> larger amounts than you do glyphosate.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffreykabat/2017/10/23/iarcs-glyphosate-gate-scandal/#43d1fd851abd\">some problems</a> with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/who-iarc-glyphosate/\">that classification.</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Every other major organization has found no link between glyphosate and cancer.</p>\n\n<p>EFSA:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/151112\">The      peer review group concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to be         genotoxic  (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to         humans. Glyphosate is not proposed to be classified as  carcinogenic        under the EU regulation for classification,  labelling and  packaging  of      chemical substances. In particular,  all the Member  State experts   but     one agreed that neither the  epidemiological data  (i.e. on   humans) nor     the evidence from  animal studies  demonstrated causality   between     exposure to  glyphosate and the  development of cancer in   humans.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Canadian toxicologist who wrote one of the papers <strong>cited in the IARC report</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.producer.com/daily/toxicologist-pans-un-glyphosate-report/#.VRcWRvrM3o4.twitter\">\u201cThey      (IARC) got this totally wrong.
