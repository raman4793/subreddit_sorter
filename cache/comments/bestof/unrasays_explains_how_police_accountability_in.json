You find one, relax and enjoy it.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/02/14/a-day-with-killology-police-trainer-dave-grossman/\n\n>Despite the US govt\u2019s unwillingness to track police violence, we now have comprehensive data on killings by police via WaPo, http://mappingpoliceviolence.org & http://fatalencounters.org. While we don\u2019t have enough data on non-fatal violence, we can learn a lot from the data we *do* have...\n\n>When we break down the data by city, there are massive differences in police violence rates per population. St Louis, OKC and Orlando consistently have the highest rates of police violence. Killings are 3x less frequent in SF or Philly, 4x less in Detroit. http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities\n\n>Who\u2019s impacted by this violence? Black and brown people. This chart shows the race of unarmed people killed by police in major cities from 2013-19. Almost everyone was Black or Latinx. Black people are 3x more likely than whites to be killed by police & more likely to be unarmed.\n\n>Among places that reduced police shootings, SF, Philly, Chicago, Denver, San Jose, LA, Phoenix and Baltimore made their use of force policies more restrictive during this period. Many had DOJ investigations. & many reformed enforcement of drugs/low level crime, reducing arrests.\n\n>This is consistent with previous research finding departments with more restrictive use of force policies (http://useofforceproject.org) and DOJ interventions predict reduced police violence. Despite this, the Trump admin has stopped these DOJ investigations. https://vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings\n\n>Importantly, cities that reduced police shootings did so regardless of levels of crime. Crime rates (including violent crime rates) actually went up slightly in major cities during this period - but police shootings declined consistently with a 41% reduction during this time.\n\n>There are other factors researchers have identified as impacting police violence rates. More racial segregation predicts more police violence (https://bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/). **So does receiving military weapons from the feds** (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209\n).\n\n>On the other hand, having more Black officers is NOT associated with reducing police violence in most studies (some studies suggest more women on the force can help tho). Implicit bias training also hasn\u2019t been shown to make a real difference. But a factor that DOES matter is...\n\n>THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. Just as some depts have higher violence rates, some officers have higher violence rates too. In Columbus, 6% of officers commit 50% of all use of force. When the system fails to hold them accountable it causes MAJOR problems...\n\n>See now we can track how police misconduct spreads. And officers in close proximity to officers who have records of misconduct end up being 4x more likely to use force & 5x more likely to shoot someone. We can *contact trace* police violence like a virus. https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/\n\n>Accountability systems work if they intervene & remove officers BEFORE misconduct spreads/escalates. But only 7% of excessive force complaints are upheld/result in discipline and 1% of killings result in prosecution. So these officers remain on the force. https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/data_stories/police-use-of-force-data-a-huge-mess-across-the-u-s/\n\n>Here too, data helps us understand how to increase accountability and decrease police violence. Misconduct complaints are more likely to be upheld when depts have body cams (video=key) but much less likely to be upheld in depts with police union contracts. https://gothamgazette.com/city/9167-initial-report-shows-benefits-and-challenges-of-nypd-body-camera-program-for-watchdog-agency\n\n>This is because police union contracts are where the accountability system is set. Most contracts purge misconduct records, restrict misconduct investigations and help officers overturn discipline and get reinstated after being fired for misconduct. http://checkthepolice.org\n\n>In fact, police depts with union contracts that grant more procedural protections to officers accused of misconduct are:\n1) more likely to be reported for misconduct\n2) less likely to uphold misconduct complaints\n3) more likely to kill unarmed people https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419\n\n>So the contracts matter, and they need to be re-negotiated to increase levels of accountability and to reduce police violence. But what about the exceedingly low rate of officers being prosecuted? Well, we know more about this topic now than we did 5 years ago. For example...\n\n>While only 1% of all killings by police result in officers being charged with a crime, this 1% isn\u2019t evenly distributed. There are a handful of places that routinely charge officers while almost every other place fails to do so. And those places tend to have Black prosecutors.\n\n>We still don\u2019t know what tactics these prosecutors are using to secure indictments in these cases, but electing prosecutors (esp. Black prosecutors) who genuinely care about holding police accountable is important. This + video evidence are factors that can make the difference.\n\n>So we now know:\n>1) which depts have the worst police violence rates & which are reducing it\n>2) a set of interventions/factors associated with reducing this violence and increasing accountability\n\n>By continuing to study & scale up what works we can end police violence nationwide.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/samswey/status/1259254114606886913", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>More data:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A day with &#39;killology&#39; police trainer Dave Grossman</p>\n\n<p>Grossman at one point tells his students that the sex they have after they kill another human being will be the best sex of their lives.

You find one, relax and enjoy it.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/02/14/a-day-with-killology-police-trainer-dave-grossman/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/02/14/a-day-with-killology-police-trainer-dave-grossman/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite the US govt\u2019s unwillingness to track police violence, we now have comprehensive data on killings by police via WaPo, <a href=\"http://mappingpoliceviolence.org\">http://mappingpoliceviolence.org</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://fatalencounters.org\">http://fatalencounters.org</a>. While we don\u2019t have enough data on non-fatal violence, we can learn a lot from the data we <em>do</em> have...</p>\n\n<p>When we break down the data by city, there are massive differences in police violence rates per population. St Louis, OKC and Orlando consistently have the highest rates of police violence. Killings are 3x less frequent in SF or Philly, 4x less in Detroit. <a href=\"http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities\">http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities</a></p>\n\n<p>Who\u2019s impacted by this violence? Black and brown people. This chart shows the race of unarmed people killed by police in major cities from 2013-19. Almost everyone was Black or Latinx. Black people are 3x more likely than whites to be killed by police &amp; more likely to be unarmed.</p>\n\n<p>Among places that reduced police shootings, SF, Philly, Chicago, Denver, San Jose, LA, Phoenix and Baltimore made their use of force policies more restrictive during this period. Many had DOJ investigations. &amp; many reformed enforcement of drugs/low level crime, reducing arrests.</p>\n\n<p>This is consistent with previous research finding departments with more restrictive use of force policies (<a href=\"http://useofforceproject.org\">http://useofforceproject.org</a>) and DOJ interventions predict reduced police violence. Despite this, the Trump admin has stopped these DOJ investigations. <a href=\"https://vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings\">https://vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings</a></p>\n\n<p>Importantly, cities that reduced police shootings did so regardless of levels of crime. Crime rates (including violent crime rates) actually went up slightly in major cities during this period - but police shootings declined consistently with a 41% reduction during this time.</p>\n\n<p>There are other factors researchers have identified as impacting police violence rates. More racial segregation predicts more police violence (<a href=\"https://bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/\">https://bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/</a>). <strong>So does receiving military weapons from the feds</strong> (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209\">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209</a>\n).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, having more Black officers is NOT associated with reducing police violence in most studies (some studies suggest more women on the force can help tho). Implicit bias training also hasn\u2019t been shown to make a real difference. But a factor that DOES matter is...</p>\n\n<p>THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. Just as some depts have higher violence rates, some officers have higher violence rates too. In Columbus, 6% of officers commit 50% of all use of force. When the system fails to hold them accountable it causes MAJOR problems...</p>\n\n<p>See now we can track how police misconduct spreads. And officers in close proximity to officers who have records of misconduct end up being 4x more likely to use force &amp; 5x more likely to shoot someone. We can <em>contact trace</em> police violence like a virus. <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/\">https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/</a></p>\n\n<p>Accountability systems work if they intervene &amp; remove officers BEFORE misconduct spreads/escalates. But only 7% of excessive force complaints are upheld/result in discipline and 1% of killings result in prosecution. So these officers remain on the force. <a href=\"https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/data_stories/police-use-of-force-data-a-huge-mess-across-the-u-s/\">https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/data_stories/police-use-of-force-data-a-huge-mess-across-the-u-s/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here too, data helps us understand how to increase accountability and decrease police violence. Misconduct complaints are more likely to be upheld when depts have body cams (video=key) but much less likely to be upheld in depts with police union contracts. <a href=\"https://gothamgazette.com/city/9167-initial-report-shows-benefits-and-challenges-of-nypd-body-camera-program-for-watchdog-agency\">https://gothamgazette.com/city/9167-initial-report-shows-benefits-and-challenges-of-nypd-body-camera-program-for-watchdog-agency</a></p>\n\n<p>This is because police union contracts are where the accountability system is set. Most contracts purge misconduct records, restrict misconduct investigations and help officers overturn discipline and get reinstated after being fired for misconduct. <a href=\"http://checkthepolice.org\">http://checkthepolice.org</a></p>\n\n<p>In fact, police depts with union contracts that grant more procedural protections to officers accused of misconduct are:\n1) more likely to be reported for misconduct\n2) less likely to uphold misconduct complaints\n3) more likely to kill unarmed people <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419</a></p>\n\n<p>So the contracts matter, and they need to be re-negotiated to increase levels of accountability and to reduce police violence. But what about the exceedingly low rate of officers being prosecuted? Well, we know more about this topic now than we did 5 years ago. For example...</p>\n\n<p>While only 1% of all killings by police result in officers being charged with a crime, this 1% isn\u2019t evenly distributed. There are a handful of places that routinely charge officers while almost every other place fails to do so. And those places tend to have Black prosecutors.</p>\n\n<p>We still don\u2019t know what tactics these prosecutors are using to secure indictments in these cases, but electing prosecutors (esp. Black prosecutors) who genuinely care about holding police accountable is important. This + video evidence are factors that can make the difference.</p>\n\n<p>So we now know:\n1) which depts have the worst police violence rates &amp; which are reducing it\n2) a set of interventions/factors associated with reducing this violence and increasing accountability</p>\n\n<p>By continuing to study &amp; scale up what works we can end police violence nationwide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1259254114606886913\">https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1259254114606886913</a></p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "bestof", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/bestof/comments/giqwbl/unrasays_explains_how_police_accountability_in/fqggilh/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqggilh", "created": 1589374479.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589345679.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 30, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_giqwbl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_giqwbl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_giqwbl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqj77yp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "Seasonal", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589405992.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqj3agq", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3yoh6", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "body": "It looks like my state (TN) does not have red flag laws.

There are an equal number of assholes in any profession.\n\nTo that I always respond:\n\nA) Yes, it's a difficult job. So is being a nurse and a teacher and many other roles. People going into these professions know it is and adjust their expectations and behaviours accordingly. Also, while being a cop can be dangerous, there are plenty of other dangerous professions (many are even moreso, see coal miners, construction labourers, etc) but that isn't an excuse for violent behaviour.\n\nB) Even if it is a small number, there's a culture and administration in policing that protects these bad apples.
