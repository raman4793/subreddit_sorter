This is a problem barely one step harder than <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/\">FizzBuzz</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many people work in software for ten+ years and end up repeating the same year of experience every time. Don&#39;t be that person! If you see something like &quot;binary tree&quot; that you&#39;re not familiar with, your reaction should be &quot;I should learn how that works!&quot;, not &quot;I&#39;ve never needed that yet, and so I will ignore it.&quot; How can you know if you&#39;d be able to use it until you understand it?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been programming professionally for 30+ years, and I <em>still</em> see things I haven&#39;t used before, and I dig into how they work and how to use them. And you know what? Just knowing how all of those things work means that I <em>find uses for them</em>. It stretches my ability to create more complex and sophisticated algorithms. And it means I get to solve the harder problems--and my job security is generally higher. If you want to level up your career, you need to keep learning.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": "comment score below threshold", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ProgrammerHumor", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/gj01d8/why_you_do_this_google/fqiucu9/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqiucu9", "created": 1589429809.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": true, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ProgrammerHumor", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -5, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj01d8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 17, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj01d8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -5, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj01d8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj01d8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqjc91h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": "hackathons2", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589407919.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqiv6gb", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_xu6sd", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2tex6", "body": "Damn, everytime I see that phrase I imagine choosing a new node to be root and picking up the tree by that root and letting everything dangle down, randomly switching parent, child, and sibling relations of the tree.\n\nIn any case, why would you want to alter the tree when you could just traverse it in the opposite order?
