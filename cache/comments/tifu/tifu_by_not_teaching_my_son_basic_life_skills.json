I feel pretty dang prepared for life compared to a lot of people my age - my parents are older so started teaching me about saving for retirement from a young age, my mom taught me to do my taxes by hand, I learned to use Excel for budgeting and financial projections when I saved and bought a horse on my own dime (and in doing so took on the responsibility of his monthly expenses) at 16, etc. - and yet there are certain gaps in my knowledge that are baffling in comparison. I didn&#39;t know how to order pizza until I was 18. I can fill and change a tire, change oil, and operate several different power tools, but would be completely lost for where to start trying to use a barbecue (although I&#39;m not sure that one is on them, trying to teach teenage me to cook went about as smoothly as giving a cat swimming lessons).</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "tifu", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/tifu/comments/giwcmd/tifu_by_not_teaching_my_son_basic_life_skills/fqk9b18/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqk9b18", "created": 1589451450.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589422650.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tifu", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_giwcmd", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqkb274", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "Mrjohnson1100", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_giwcmd", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_10jndp", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2to41", "body": "My 13 year old put a pot of water in the microwave to heat it up...now we have a perfectly good pan with no handle, yep, the plastic handle snapped clean off about an inch from the pan.
