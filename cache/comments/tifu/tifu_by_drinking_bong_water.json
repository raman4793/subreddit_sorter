So, i asked my friend to clean out my bong for me while i go make some sandwiches (PB&J, this'll be important later) for us. When i say clean, i mean replace the water in it because that's what i like to do before every smoke session. For clarification, i don't have a vertical bong... i have a globe bong. While he was cleaning it, he decided to dump some of it in a cup in my room. He KNEW that was my cup and he KNEW that it was filled with ice cold water that i was drinking beforehand. While i'm in the kitchen, i hear him in my bathroom dumping whatever water was left in the bong and replacing it. For context, i live in a 2 floored apartment (which sounds kinda odd but when i say 2 floored i mean my exact apartment was a 2 floored) with my family. My room is on the first floor and it is next to the main bathroom and the kitchen, which is why i hear the bathroom sink running when he replaced the water in it.

You know when you can tell there is a bit of food stuck in your throat after eating something like peanut butter? Yeah, i didn't want to hit my bong and have something like peanut butter stuck in my throat. I grabbed my water which was in one of those dark blue cups you can semi see through. And i drink a bit and that's when it hit me... the dirty taste of weed/bong water. And oh god it tasted horrible with the sandwich. He was laughing his ass off and after he had his moment of dying, he told me what he did. I didn't do much about it other than say to him \"Your kind of a dickhead, but a smart one.
