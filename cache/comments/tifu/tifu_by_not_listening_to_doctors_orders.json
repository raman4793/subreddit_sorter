[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": 1, "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "tifu", "selftext": "So a few years ago I got really sick basically instantly. Like one minute I\u2019m fine and then I have a fever of 104 and I\u2019m laying on the floor dying. So I end up in the ER. I tell the doctor everything that I have going on and he thinks I have meningitis. \n\nNow the fun thing about meningitis is that in order to test for it you have to do a spinal tap. Think tapping a tree for sap or tapping a keg. Same concept. Stick a big ass needle into the spine to get cerebral spinal fluid out. They run the tests and I don\u2019t have meningitis. No idea what\u2019s wrong with me. \n\nAs in getting ready to get discharged and go home the doctor says that I need to lay on my stomach and move as little as possible for the next 5 days. I\u2019m listening and auto bobbing my head like yeah yeah sure whatever. This was the exact moment I fucked up. \n\nSee what I didn\u2019t know is that when you get a spinal tap there is a scab that forms that prevents cerebral spinal fluid from leaking into your body. And if you move too much this scab comes off. And if this scab comes off and you start leaking cerebral spinal fluid you no longer have a liquid barrier protecting your brain from bouncing off the inside of your skull like a pinball. \n\nSo there I am. Two days out and feeling better. Getting back to normal life. All of the doctors words forgotten. Then the headache hit. \n\nI have had headaches and I have had migraines. Those are amateur hour compared to this. Imagine John Henry laying railroad inside your head while a Norwegian death metal band plays the soundtrack. I lose most of the vision in my left eye. I\u2019m sick to my stomach and vomiting because of the pain. The only thing I can physically do is lay in bed. Ironic. \n\nI\u2019m fairly young and in good shape. I\u2019m in three military. I hate doctors and hospitals. This leads to fuck up numero dos. My wife says I should go back to the hospital. My exact words were \u201cI will be fine, I was just in the hospital and I\u2019m not going back.\u201d I made it three days. \n\nSo there I am back in the same ER. Feeling like an idiot with no idea why my North Korea conducted their latest nuclear test inside my skull. I explain to the doctor everything including being in the ER a few days ago. He starts laughing. Yeah real funny doc. He tells me I\u2019m an idiot but it\u2019s an easy fix. He tells me I\u2019m not gonna like it. \n\nHe comes in with the biggest needle I have ever seen. Like I\u2019m wondering if I ended up at a horse veterinarian. Is that big. The syringe holds a pint. If you have ever spent any time in shitty night clubs just imagine the syringe that the girls walk around with filled with Jell-O shots. I ask what he is gonna do but honestly I\u2019m in so much pain I\u2019m just hoping he kills me with it. He tells me they are going to fill that syringe with blood from my arm and insert it into my back. Ok. \n\nBefore we start they call for a special nurse. By special I mean they called for the biggest guy they had to help hold me. We will call him bubba  because I don\u2019t remember his name.  He comes in and looks me right in the eye and says \u201cI got you, it\u2019s gonna be ok.\u201d And now I know I\u2019m fucked. They get to it. Taking the blood out was not that bad. Kinda like giving blood on fast forward. Putting the blood in was... something. \n\nI felt the needle go in. I felt bubba squeeze my hand reassuringly and place all of his weight on my body. I felt warmth run up and down my spine. Then the angels sang and the heavens parted. I felt liquid flow into my skull and surround my brain. Then I felt no pain. Instant relief. \n\nAs I was getting ready to leave the doctor told me that I needed to lay on my stomach for 5 days moving as little as possible.

Here it is without the indents:\n\nSo a few years ago I got really sick basically instantly. Like one minute I\u2019m fine and then I have a fever of 104 and I\u2019m laying on the floor dying. So I end up in the ER. I tell the doctor everything that I have going on and he thinks I have meningitis.\n\nNow the fun thing about meningitis is that in order to test for it you have to do a spinal tap. Think tapping a tree for sap or tapping a keg. Same concept. Stick a big ass needle into the spine to get cerebral spinal fluid out. They run the tests and I don\u2019t have meningitis. No idea what\u2019s wrong with me. \n\nAs in getting ready to get discharged and go home the doctor says that I need to lay on my stomach and move as little as possible for the next 5 days. I\u2019m listening and auto bobbing my head like yeah yeah sure whatever. This was the exact moment I fucked up.\n \nSee what I didn\u2019t know is that when you get a spinal tap there is a scab that forms that prevents cerebral spinal fluid from leaking into your body. And if you move too much this scab comes off. And if this scab comes off and you start leaking cerebral spinal fluid you no longer have a liquid barrier \nprotecting your brain from bouncing off the inside of your skull like a pinball. \n\nSo there I am. Two days out and feeling better. Getting back to normal life. All of the doctors words forgotten. Then the headache hit. \n\nI have had headaches and I have had migraines. Those are amateur hour compared to this. Imagine John Henry laying railroad inside your head while a Norwegian death metal band plays the soundtrack. I lose most of the vision in my left eye. I\u2019m sick to my stomach and vomiting because of the pain. The only thing I can physically do is lay in bed. Ironic. \n\nI\u2019m fairly young and in good shape. I\u2019m in three military. I hate doctors and hospitals. This leads to fuck up numero dos. My wife says I should go back to the hospital. My exact words were \u201cI will be fine, I was just in the hospital and I\u2019m not going back.\u201d I made it three days. \n\nSo there I am back in the same ER. Feeling like an idiot with no idea why my North Korea conducted their latest nuclear test inside my skull. I explain to the doctor everything including being in the ER a few days ago. He starts laughing. Yeah real funny doc. He tells me I\u2019m an idiot but it\u2019s an easy fix. He tells me I\u2019m not gonna like it. \n\nHe comes in with the biggest needle I have ever seen. Like I\u2019m wondering if I ended up at a horse veterinarian. Is that big. The syringe holds a pint. If you have ever spent any time in shitty night clubs just imagine the syringe that the girls walk around with filled with Jell-O shots. I ask what he is gonna do but honestly I\u2019m in so much pain I\u2019m just hoping he kills me with it. He tells me they are going to fill that syringe with blood from my arm and insert it into my back. Ok. \n\nBefore we start they call for a special nurse. By special I mean they called for the biggest guy they had to help hold me. We will call him bubba  because I don\u2019t remember his name.  He comes in and looks me right in the eye and says \u201cI got you, it\u2019s gonna be ok.\u201d And now I know I\u2019m fucked. They get to it. Taking the blood out was not that bad. Kinda like giving blood on fast forward. Putting the blood in was... something. \n\nI felt the needle go in. I felt bubba squeeze my hand reassuringly and place all of his weight on my body. I felt warmth run up and down my spine. Then the angels sang and the heavens parted. I felt liquid flow into my skull and surround my brain. Then I felt no pain. Instant relief. \n\nAs I was getting ready to leave the doctor told me that I needed to lay on my stomach for 5 days moving as little as possible.

Like one minute I\u2019m fine and then I have a fever of 104 and I\u2019m laying on the floor dying. So I end up in the ER. I tell the doctor everything that I have going on and he thinks I have meningitis.    Now the fun thing about meningitis is that in order to test for it you have to do a spinal tap. Think tapping a tree for sap or tapping a keg. Same concept. Stick a big ass needle into the spine to get cerebral spinal fluid out. They run the tests and I don\u2019t have meningitis. No idea what\u2019s wrong with me.    As in getting ready to get discharged and go home the doctor says that I need to lay on my stomach and move as little as possible for the next 5 days. I\u2019m listening and auto bobbing my head like yeah yeah sure whatever. This was the exact moment I fucked up.    See what I didn\u2019t know is that when you get a spinal tap there is a scab that forms that prevents cerebral spinal fluid from leaking into your body. And if you move too much this scab comes off. And if this scab comes off and you start leaking cerebral spinal fluid you no longer have a liquid barrier protecting your brain from bouncing off the inside of your skull like a pinball.    So there I am. Two days out and feeling better. Getting back to normal life. All of the doctors words forgotten. Then the headache hit.   I have had headaches and I have had migraines. Those are amateur hour compared to this. Imagine John Henry laying railroad inside your head while a Norwegian death metal band plays the soundtrack. I lose most of the vision in my left eye. I\u2019m sick to my stomach and vomiting because of the pain. The only thing I can physically do is lay in bed. Ironic.    I\u2019m fairly young and in good shape. I\u2019m in three military. I hate doctors and hospitals. This leads to fuck up numero dos. My wife says I should go back to the hospital. My exact words were \u201cI will be fine, I was just in the hospital and I\u2019m not going back.\u201d I made it three days.     So there I am back in the same ER. Feeling like an idiot with no idea why my North Korea conducted their latest nuclear test inside my skull. I explain to the doctor everything including being in the ER a few days ago. He starts laughing. Yeah real funny doc. He tells me I\u2019m an idiot but it\u2019s an easy fix. He tells me I\u2019m not gonna like it.    He comes in with the biggest needle I have ever seen. Like I\u2019m wondering if I ended up at a horse veterinarian. Is that big. The syringe holds a pint. If you have ever spent any time in shitty night clubs just imagine the syringe that the girls walk around with filled with Jell-O shots. I ask what he is gonna do but honestly I\u2019m in so much pain I\u2019m just hoping he kills me with it. He tells me they are going to fill that syringe with blood from my arm and insert it into my back. Ok.    Before we start they call for a special nurse. By special I mean they called for the biggest guy they had to help hold me. We will call him bubba  because I don\u2019t remember his name.
