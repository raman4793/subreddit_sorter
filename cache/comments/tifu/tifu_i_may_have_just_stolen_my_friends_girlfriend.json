And at the time I was super supportive,  he seemed happier and generally more positive (in my eyes more power to him). But then he decided to introduce her to our small circle of friends, apparently, this was due to the fact that she (the co-worker)  had been through a rough relationship in the past and wanted to not be alone with him (for context know that my friend is not an intimidating guy, kind of a short king and an absolute sweetheart) so while I found this odd, I was more than happy to support him and welcome the co-worker into our group, the more the merrier, right?\n\nAnyway time passed, and I felt like there was some surface tension between the two but I thought nothing of it when just recently on mother's day I  arranged for us all to go to the local hangout after everyone had finished with their families. Somehow only the co-worker and I were the only ones to be able to go, so for a few hours I fumbled about trying to make conversation (at best as a dorky dolt, at worst an idiot) and she began a conversation about some more *sexual interest*. I've been around the block and have been through a few relationships, so I'm fairly comfortable talking about these things but even I thought this was weird, but again new person so like whatever. She continued to explain how things were in her life at home and how she wanted to move away, and it more than slightly seemed like she was insinuating that I join her as her roommate (*she directly said it at some point*). She explained that she'd ask my friend but it had seemed that I had my life together a bit better, I was flattered but had to decline politely. **But this is where it really begins to unravel**, as she began to talk about how she didn't feel the same about my friend as he did about her. She could tell I was a tad off by now and changed subjects. Eventually, she begins to seem like she's got something important to say but was holding it back. I wasn't sure what to do, because it seemed like she was leading me up to ask her how she felt about me. I knew it was inappropriate so I avoided it like the plague. Suddenly I got a text from a friend, arranging for us to meet up together somewhere else, saved by the bell I suppose.\n\nSince then she's been passively flirty with me, asking for hugs and touching me like a lovesick teenager, don't get me wrong she's cute and a total type for me, but the circumstance is clearly not ok. Most recently she'd lent me a book, kinda saucy for my taste but eh, and I don't really know what to do with it all.\n\nSo  Reddit, what the hell should I do, I'm not in a relationship but don't want to lose any friends, if I'm honest with myself I know its a bad situation, and I need to step back, but honestly, it is nice to feel wanted.
