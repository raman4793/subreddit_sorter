And for the record, yes, I am completely incapable of making a good decision, so settle in for a long one.\n\nI had just finished up work on my laptop for the day and was bored, so I went to the mailroom to go collect a package. I had gotten a vr headset to use with a new drone I had bought a few weeks back out of desperate need for something to do in quarantine and was raring to show it off to my girlfriend.\n\nI start setting up the drone and notice that the battery of the drone displays 2 out of 5 and I think to myself that I'll make it a quick flight just for a demonstration and then charge it. I get the VR and drone ready, turn on the drone in the living room to test it, ask the GF to put the headset on, take the drone out to the 2nd story patio and I make the drone shoot up above the apartment.\n\n\"Woooaaahhh, that's so cool! I can see the restaurant across the street!\"\n\nShe's loving it! I'll fly it around a little bit like I've done dozens of times before and try the VR headset myself. But something's wrong... The drone is drifting towards the roof. I try to control it the other direction but it's gone rogue. I glance  at the battery level on my controller and the drone's battery had dropped to 0 out of five. It was now in \"Return Home\" mode and since I had initially turned it on inside it decided to land right above that; the roof, where it landed on it's side, unable to move.\n\nShit.\n\nSo I talked to GF about the situation, trying to figure out what to do. We went outside and saw it on the opposite side of the roof, over the hump. We could contact the apartment main office and ask if someone could somehow retrieve it, but we decided they would 1) be annoyed, and 2) probably wouldn't get around to it for a while (plus we have rain on the forecast), so I decided to try something a bit more eccentric. Drive a big remote control car on the roof with a rope trailing behind. My thought process was that I could drive around the drone to hook it and then reel  them both in with the string. Wanna guess how that went? Pretty well actually.... right up until the RC car sputtered to a halt. I forgot to charge it's battery too. \n\nFUCK. ME.\n\nAlright, so by this point a myriad of bad decisions have been made. I am a fool. So, what does a reasonable person do, now that they're looking a $300 loss in the face? Do they call it a loss? Do they suck up their pride and go to the office for help? Probably. Well that's not what I did. I decided to wait until it was dark and climb up on top of the roof to get them myself.\n\n-_-\n\nSO, after a few minutes of trying to muster up the courage, I hobble up on to the railing and slowly lift myself up on to the edge of the roof like the fat ninja I am. This is where I start to panic. There isn't much below me at this point besides the railing and a now 3 story drop. All I can do is palm the roof tiles as hard as I can and use every last drop of strength I have to drag my sack of lard body, belly first, fully up onto the roof, trying not to fall backwards from the sheer might that is gravity.\n\n\"When did I get so fat???\"\n\nDrained from my initial success I lay there motionlessness. A dark blob on the roof to anyone who might happen a glance my direction. After a minute to compose myself I started to crawl. I just had to get over the hump of the roof and I'd be able to see the RC's. Still on my belly I dragged myself up, inch by inch, too afraid to lift myself up due to the steep angle of the roof. Every second lasted an eternity. After what felt like an hour I reached the top and was in reaching distance of the rogue toys, but I just sat there a beat to rest before my return home. In that moment I thought about many things. When will quarantine end? Why do the tops of buildings always look so bland? How did I end up on the roof? All questions for later. \n\nI spun around onto my butt, grabbed the vehicles, and began scooting ass first down the roof, stopping every scoot to place the toys further down so I could grip the roof tiles better. It was only when I got to the bottom of the roof when I realized my one fatal flaw.\n\nHOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO GET DOWN?!?\n\nThe simple answer? I wasn't supposed to. I am an foolish foolish man person and I was now stuck on the roof. 5 minutes pass and I still can't think of anything. I resort to one of my last lifelines; My wonderful amazing GF. I get my phone out and call her and ask her to come outside. Like the savior she is, she rushed outside and quickly started helping me brainstorm. We ended up deciding on me climbing down the wall that divides me and my neighbor while she holds me against it as best she can, and somehow, miraculously even, I'm able to shimmy down the wall, but not before I see a shape move by in their window.\n\nPretty sure they saw me, and also pretty sure our first time meeting will be one to remember. But that's a problem for tomorrow's me.\n\nAnyways, that's how my day went. This took me a long time to write, so I feel much more calm now, but some lessons were definitely learned throughout this experience. \n\nTl;Dr:.
