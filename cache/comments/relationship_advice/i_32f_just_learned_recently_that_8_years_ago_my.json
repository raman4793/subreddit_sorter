There was absolutely nothing wrong with the dog. My boyfriend was angry over the break up. His ex fiance wanted nothing more to do with him but had asked to take their dog with her. He had felt his ex fiancee loved the dog more so he had asked for one more day with the dog, drove to the vet and watched their dog of 6 years get put to death. \n\nI'm an animal lover but I don't want any pets because I don't have the means or time to take care of them. That said, I would never punished an animal because of what's happening between me and another person. And God, the way my boyfriend told this story with this small smile on his face. It scared and disgusted me. \n\nIt's been almost 4 days since he told me and things between us are now weird. He tried to initiate sex today but I told him I was tired and needed to sleep but I'm still wide awake. I can't stop thinking about what he did. By all accounts my boyfriend was a wonderful, loving and caring man but now I see him in a new light. I told my close friends about this and they don't see what's the problem. They asked if I'm really going to break up a stable relationship over what he did to a dog over 8 years ago but they didn't see the look on his face when he told me. I'm sure a part of him had enjoyed it. If he's willing to euthanized a dog over a break up then what isn't he willing to do? That's what I'm afraid of. I don't know what to do. I broke my lease to come live with my boyfriend but...there's a part of me that doesn't want to stay here anymore. \n\nHas anyone else ever dealt with this kind of thing?

I think that&#39;s why I&#39;m so confused over this situation and why I&#39;m weary of him now. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you. I&#39;m trying to see if I can come up with money to lease an apartment.
