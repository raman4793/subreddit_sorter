Original post starts below.\n\n\n\n\nSo for context: we are college students (I am 21F and he\u2019s 21M) who met freshman year (we\u2019re juniors now) through mutual friends and have been acquaintances until this January, when we were in a discussion section for a class together and started talking more. It was just friendly, and stayed that way the whole time (I have had a string of not great romantic/sexual experiences in college and have sort of put a full pause on flirting, dating, etc. for a while and have always been very blunt with my friends, including him, about it). Since the pandemic hit I moved back home and we only communicate over text now. Let\u2019s just call him James.\n\nJames\u2019 roommate, Leon [22M], is tight with one of my best friends, Sam [21M]. Leon decided to move back home when school shut down as well, and while he was packing, he came across a rolled up small print in the back of their shared closet, and unrolled it to see if it belonged to him or not, The image was a drawing of a girl nude performing a sexually explicit act, and she looks.... exactly like me. Like I\u2019m not even really friends with Leon and he immediately thought \u201coh, that kind of looks like OP\u201d. Face, body type, even BOTH of my birthmarks (one in a very noticeable spot and one he would only know about from me mentioning it in passing) is all eerily similar to me. Leon immediately got spooked and took a photo of it and sent it to Sam because he thought I should be notified of the print\u2019s existence. \n\nSam forwarded it to me and I found the original artist\u2019s Twitter handle off the signature. He\u2019s an NSFW artist who also does commissions and will often post those commissions after completing them, and sure enough, I scrolled back far enough to find what is basically my naked body drawn on this man\u2019s timeline, posted all the way back in FEBRUARY, which means James had paid for it like months ago, maybe right when we found out we had a class together. I\u2019ve been talking to him for months and he\u2019s had this for basically the whole time.\n\nThis discovery was two weeks ago and I feel fucking disgusting and honestly violated. I stopped talking to him for the most part\u2014 but I am afraid that he will circulate the image more if I stop speaking to him entirely or tell him that i know. His roommate promised not to say anything because he was pretty disgusted too and as far as I know he\u2019s stayed true to that. I want to cut James off completely and I want the artist to remove the post of the commission from his Twitter, but I\u2019m so scared and ashamed to reach out because I hate drawing more attention to the fact that this drawing even fucking exists, and I shudder thinking about the artist possibly using reference photos of me for the drawing.\n\nSo I guess my advice requests are:\n\n1. Should I bother trying to get the post taken down and if I do, how do I make sure he does it?\n2. Should I confront James? I never want to speak to this man again but I would be mortified if he circulated the image at all. Should I just block him? Is there someone I should report him to or something?\n3. Is this an overreaction and should I do nothing? I haven\u2019t told any of my friends besides the one who informed me because it makes me so uncomfortable and I need an outside perspective. I have never shown any kind of sexual interest in this man and just wanted to be his friend, and she showed absolutely zero interest in me as well. He\u2019s had this image for months, all while still talking to me and it makes me feel so fucking icky and brings back memories of aforementioned shitty sexual experiences and I just don\u2019t want to be around him.\n\nSorry if this was overly long, I\u2019m just really over my head here.\n\nTLDR: found out my \u201cfriend\u201d commissioned an NSFW drawing that is unmistakably of me from an artist on Twitter and I don\u2019t know how to remove him from my life without worrying about him circulating it or how to get it taken down from Twitter.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Found out my friend commissioned a sexually graphic drawing of me without my knowledge or consent and I don\u2019t know what to do.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_gipjxn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10611, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6gm1c7w1", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "num_duplicates": 1, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1589390970.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589363768.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>EDIT: oh my fucking god???

After his peace bond in the assault case was lifted (literally the DAY it was over), he reactivated this account and started posting pics and videos with me in them and luckily for me, those friends saw them and notified me.

Your best bet is to message the artist, explain the situation and hope they are reasonable and voluntarily remove it.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gipjxn/found_out_my_friend_commissioned_a_sexually/fqhfb4q/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqhfb4q", "created": 1589404575.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589375775.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 8, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gipjxn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqh132a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": "thatlannisterbitch", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gipjxn", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_46j5noit", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "body": "I'm pretty sure this falls under non-consensual pornography which is protected against by most countries (sometimes under revenge porn acts).

You don\u2019t have to do this and could follow what others are saying but this is mainly action that will be more direct.\n\nIt also seems that because your still in college the college can help as well and take action. I would refer to them first and ask a dean, or someone higher up, what to do. Worst case scenario, the guy gets removed from the school.\n\nBased on others users and what I\u2019ve heard this is also a stalker case and could also potentially fall under sexual harassment. Which means the one in possession of the art could be sent to prison, which is the worst case scenario. \n\nHere are answers to your questions:\n\n1. You should most definitely get the post removed from Twitter. I\u2019m sure the artist will take it down if you tell them and explain the situation. If they don\u2019t then you can contact Twitter directly to get it removed as well as report the post. You can contact either by email or direct message. If those don\u2019t work law enforcement can forcefully get it removed once you file a case.\n\n2. In this case I wouldn\u2019t confront him alone, it presents too much of a danger in the fact that you will be bringing a looming threat upon yourself. I would contact a dean or higher up in the college to assist you in what to do. The college has guidelines and will take action and help you to resolve the issue. I would block all communications with him, but if a staff member of the college who is helping you asks for some form of evidence don\u2019t be afraid to give it up. (I want to add that this happened to me but the situation was that the person was somewhat stalking me and was trying to harm themselves to get to me, I informed the principals and they help to resolve the issue steadfast.)\n\n3. You are not overreacting, this is a perfectly normal response to such situations. You should do something as leaving this matter unhandled could potentially make the issue worsen over time or make someone else become a victim. If you want to tell a friend make sure you trust them enough to keep it secret, friends can be helpful in releasing some tension and being a good support to lean on. I can get a small grasp at how you feel, I would advise you to cut all communications with him and move on after dealing with the issue. \n\nObviously you don\u2019t have to do the above. If it were me I would be doing these things as it puts my mind at ease knowing the issue will be handled and I have support and some protection just in case they try to pin anything against me. It\u2019s better to get the first shoot as you\u2019re more likely to quickly resolve the issue and move on. \n\nThis worked for me when someone abused my kindness and tried to get close because they \u201cloved\u201d me (always had a bad association with that word). After I rejected them and helped them with some emotional things they immediately got aggressive at me and hinted at suicide. I contacted school staff and boom, issue was resolved in a matter of hours. Not even 24 hours had passed and the staff took action. Even the messages I reported (on Discord) had action taken against the account.\n\nSo in all honesty I do hope you proceed with caution with whatever route you choose to use. I hope you can be at ease of mind and that this never happens to you again. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting to see this happen.\n\nNevertheless, stay safe & healthy!\n\nP.S. Make sure to keep any and all evidence that can be used against him if you decide to take my advice. Staff and law enforcement WILL ask for it to determine hoe to handle the case.\n\nP.P.S. As a reassurance circulating NSFW images, drawings, etc. can be considered illegal and could potentially lead to severe jail time for the person doing so if found guilty.

If you want to tell a friend make sure you trust them enough to keep it secret, friends can be helpful in releasing some tension and being a good support to lean on. I can get a small grasp at how you feel, I would advise you to cut all communications with him and move on after dealing with the issue. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Obviously you don\u2019t have to do the above. If it were me I would be doing these things as it puts my mind at ease knowing the issue will be handled and I have support and some protection just in case they try to pin anything against me. It\u2019s better to get the first shoot as you\u2019re more likely to quickly resolve the issue and move on. </p>\n\n<p>This worked for me when someone abused my kindness and tried to get close because they \u201cloved\u201d me (always had a bad association with that word). After I rejected them and helped them with some emotional things they immediately got aggressive at me and hinted at suicide. I contacted school staff and boom, issue was resolved in a matter of hours. Not even 24 hours had passed and the staff took action. Even the messages I reported (on Discord) had action taken against the account.</p>\n\n<p>So in all honesty I do hope you proceed with caution with whatever route you choose to use. I hope you can be at ease of mind and that this never happens to you again. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting to see this happen.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, stay safe &amp; healthy!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Make sure to keep any and all evidence that can be used against him if you decide to take my advice. Staff and law enforcement WILL ask for it to determine hoe to handle the case.</p>\n\n<p>P.P.S. As a reassurance circulating NSFW images, drawings, etc. can be considered illegal and could potentially lead to severe jail time for the person doing so if found guilty. It has happened in numerous cases I\u2019ve seen so far.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gipjxn/found_out_my_friend_commissioned_a_sexually/fqim2zn/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqim2zn", "created": 1589426616.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589397816.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gipjxn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqirev9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "Cinder2134", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gipjxn", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_614pw6sx", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "body": "I'm not sure if this has been recommended yet, but you may want to go to your school's student conduct board and/or Title IX coordinator.

A few months ago my husband and I attended an art opening at a local gallery. While visiting the same gallery recently I was surprised to see a large painting depicting a man who looked exactly like my husband. When I questioned the gallery owner he explained that an artist had been taking snapshots of people at the gallery opening we attended, had taken one of my husband and made a painting from the snapshot. The painting is not particularly flattering and I am wondering if the painter has the legal right to do this. Doesn\u2019t my husband own his own image?**\n\n**A.** The short answer is no. Individuals do not have an absolute ownership right in their names or likenesses. But the law does give individuals certain rights of \u201cprivacy\u201d and \u201cpublicity\u201d which provide limited rights to control how your name, likeness, or other identifying information is used under certain circumstances. These laws vary from state to state, so they are difficult to summarize. For these purposes, I will discuss the relevant California laws as they apply to the use of names and likenesses by artists.\n\nYour right of privacy or publicity is violated when your name, voice, signature, photograph or likeness (for simplicity, I will refer to all of these as \u201clikeness\u201d below) appears in a work of art and (a) you can be clearly recognized as the subject shown in the work, (2) you have not consented to the use, and (3) the circumstances fit one of the following criteria:\n\n**(1) Invasion of privacy by intrusion into private affairs**\n\nThis right is violated when someone discloses private or sensitive matters about a private person. It covers matters that occur in private places, and also in semi-private settings where the individual had a reasonable expectation that she was seen only by a limited group of people. For example, this right is violated when a news reporter secretly videotapes a conversation with an employee at her place of work, even though her fellow employees witnessed the conversation.\n\nIn your example, the gallery might be considered such a semi-private setting. However, your husband\u2019s mere physical appearance at the opening would not qualify as a \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d matter. So the act of taking his photograph, and/or disclosing what he looks like in the subsequent painting, would not violate the intrusion right of privacy. If he had been documented doing something of a sensitive nature, such as embracing another woman, that would be a different story.\n\n**(2) Invasion of privacy by trespass or constructive trespass**\n\nThis right is violated when someone trespasses on your private property intending to capture a visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of you engaging in a \u201cpersonal and familial activity,\u201d or when he uses a device, such as a telephoto lens or audio-enhancing device, that enable him to obtain the same results as would otherwise require trespass. Insurance and criminal investigators are exempt.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t apply to your example as no such trespass was necessary to take your husband\u2019s photo in the gallery, and moreover, he wasn\u2019t engaged in a personal or familial activity. Conceivably, artists might violate this right if they used these methods to get images of a person that was later used in a painting, but the scenario seems unlikely.\n\n**(3) Invasion of privacy by public disclosure of embarrassing private facts**\n\nThis right is violated only when the disclosure is not of legitimate concern to the public. The courts are quite liberal in interpreting \u201clegitimate concern to the public,\u201d so it is difficult to prevail on a claim that this right has been violated. **Artists might violate this right if they depict a person nude, or in the course of doing something offensive.** However, if the nudity or offensive conduct occurred in public, that fact itself might be construed as matter of legitimate concern to the public.  \nIn your example, there were no embarrassing private facts disclosed. Your husband\u2019s appearance cannot be a \u201cprivate\u201d fact because by definition, it is how he appears in public.\n\n**(4) Invasion of privacy by false light disclosure**\n\nThis right is violated when your likeness is used to suggest something false and derogatory or defamatory about you. For example, suppose an individual\u2019s photograph is used to illustrate an article about drug dealing. If that individual is not a drug dealer, the article has created a false insinuation about his character.\n\nIn your example, I am assuming there is no such false insinuation. While the portrait is not flattering, that your husband doesn\u2019t like the depiction is not sufficient to support a complaint that his reputation or character has been damaged. If, however, the artist had portrayed your husband doing something offensive and false, such as robbing a bank or fondling a child, that would be a different story.\n\n**(5) Invasion of privacy by commercial appropriation / rights of publicity**\n\nThese rights are violated when a person\u2019s likeness is used on or in connection with products or merchandise (\u201cgoods\u201d), or to sell or advertise goods or services.  \nWith respect to artwork, the courts have generally considered works of fine art to be expressions of the First Amendment rights of free speech, and thus immune from liability for violation of privacy or publicity rights. Only commercial reproductions of the artwork qualify as goods under this standard. Thus, the original painting of your husband would not be a violation of his rights of privacy or publicity. However, if the artist subsequently reproduces the painting on t-shirts, postcards, etc., those items would be considered \u201ccommercial\u201d goods, and that would violate your husband\u2019s rights of privacy and publicity under this standard.\n\nThe grey area would be reproduction of the painting as a limited edition of fine art prints. Most courts consider such prints to be free speech just like the original artwork and thus, still immune from rights of privacy or publicity. For example, in New York an edition of 5,000 prints of a painting depicting Tiger Woods was held immune as an artistic expression of free speech. However, in California, the standard is more subjective. In a recent case concerning a portrait of the Three Stooges, the California Supreme Court held that artwork is immune only if it is \u201ctransformative.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the meaning of \u201ctransformative\u201d is elusive. The court said that an artwork is transformative if it is perceived as \u201cprimarily the artist\u2019s own expression rather than the subject\u2019s likeness.\u201d This could mean that the style of the rendering is what matters: if a painting is a caricature, it is probably transformative. If it\u2019s a conventional realistic portrait, it\u2019s not transformative. However, it could also mean that the artwork\u2019s appeal to the consumer is what matters: if they want to buy it because of the wonderful artistic technique, it is transformative. If they want to buy it because they want a picture of that person, it is not transformative. Most consumers don\u2019t know him, so they would want to buy the painting of your husband for its artistic quality, not because it depicts him. If it has artistic qualities beyond a conventional realistic portrait, that would further support the argument that it is transformative; for example, if stylized distortion or harsh colors contribute to the unflattering depiction.
