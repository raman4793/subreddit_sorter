I wouldn\u2019t spank my kids if I had any, but I know that isn\u2019t the viewpoint of many parents. Regardless of how you feel about spanking, what I\u2019m trying to describe seem excessive and quite unhealthy. I\u2019m concerned. \n\nSo I live in an apartment with thin walls and my neighbor (maybe late 30s white m) only lives with his girlfriend sometimes. And even less frequently than that he brings his kid over. I have never seen the kid, but lord can I hear them. \n\nUsually, if the kid is there, they\u2019re loud and happy for the most part. They play with toy instruments all day and like to sing along to movies. They laugh and play games but sometimes, out of nowhere it seems, my neighbor gets pissed with the child. He\u2019ll start saying stupid shit like \u201cbro grow up\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sick of your shit dawg\u201d and \u201cdude get over it\u201d as well as other sort of similar comments. I find this to be quite an inappropriate way to talk to your child. \n\nEvery time I hear him take this tone the kid gets worked up. They\u2019ll start to yell \u201cno no daddy no\u201d over and over again. They say things like \u201cyou scare me\u201d \u201cyou make me angry\u201d \u201cleave me alone\u201d. \nI can here them running around his apartment. \nIf my neighbor catches them, he spanks them loud enough for me to hear the slaps through the wall, and the kid screams. And screams. \n\nMost of the time the girlfriend steps in and separates them. She comforts the kid and sends the neighbor off to cool down. Then it all goes back to normal. \n\nNow my dilemma is whether or not I should call CPS. The kid can be a brat and definitely does things to set off my neighbor on occasion. However for the most part the kid sounds genuinely terrified of him. I myself don\u2019t want to confront my neighbor because he looks like a recovered meth head and he certainly isn\u2019t afraid to get physical. I\u2019m not so strong enough to be able to defend my self from a grown man losing his temper on me. \nI don\u2019t wanna rip a family apart tho. As a kid my parents weren\u2019t the greatest, and cps was called on our family, and even though it might\u2019ve been warranted sometimes, my siblings and I didn\u2019t wanna be taken away from them. We loved our parents and didn\u2019t want to be separated from one another. I also remember the cps visits doing more damage than good once they left; some of the physical abuse turned to emotional and psychological abuse which left lasting marks on each of us. We\u2019re all grown now and we\u2019ve each come to terms with how our parents raised us and our family is pretty chill now. In many ways I\u2019m very glad our family was able to stay together.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get involved if it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for everyone, but I\u2019m having a hard time figuring it out. Like I haven\u2019t even seen the kid and I know nothing aside from what I can hear through my walls. I don\u2019t really know anyone involved more than to just recognize them in building. They have only be in the building since Christmas and we haven\u2019t really talked other than when taking the elevator together. And this doesn\u2019t happen all the time, it\u2019s only a couple times a week that the kids even over, and maybe only once a week that these incidents take place. \n\nAnd honestly, while I am largely concerned for the kid, a secret selfish part of me just wants all the screaming to stop so I can sleep. Is that clouding my judgement? Would calling cps just be a selfish thing to do? \nWhat do y\u2019all think?\n\nTL;DR\nMy neighbor beats on a child I\u2019ve never seen and I can hear it all through the thin walls. I don\u2019t wanna overstep and call cps if it isn\u2019t warranted. I\u2019m trying to figure out if I\u2019m being an overreactive nosy neighbor or if I am justified in my concerns.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m really glad that I wasn\u2019t misreading things. I will be calling cps on my lunch break. I\u2019ve looked into the laws in my area and without seeing the kid I can say if he\u2019s using legal reasonable force, but that\u2019s CPS\u2019s call anyway.
