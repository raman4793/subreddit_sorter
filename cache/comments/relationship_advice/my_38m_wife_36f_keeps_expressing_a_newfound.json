I\u2019d tell her that I see plenty of women on a daily basis that I want to fuck I would never dishonor her or our marriage by rubbing her face in it. The second part of the come to Jesus talk needs to be about how maybe it\u2019s time for you two to stop wasting each others time and pursues what she really wants and you go find your own life. You need to cowboy the fuck up.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gizwb0/my_38m_wife_36f_keeps_expressing_a_newfound/fqii15v/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqii15v", "created": 1589425066.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589396266.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gizwb0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gizwb0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gizwb0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gizwb0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqksy72", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "Sufficient-Junket", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqkoa79", "score": -1, "author_fullname": "t2_5l19wmdc", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "collapsed": false, "body": "Yeah agreed. \n\nHand to my heart I don't have racist thoughts against anyone but I simply have never been attracted to typical black women.
