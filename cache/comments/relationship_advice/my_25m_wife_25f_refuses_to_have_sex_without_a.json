is the absolute WORST THING EVERRRRR and is a divorceable event. I mean sure, you can draw your relationship boundaries anywhere you want and that's totally valid, but saying she lied and intentionally trapped you into marriage by \"dangling the carrot\" of condom-free sex in front of you is ridiculous. Not saying that's what you said, OP, but that's what some other commenters are saying and you need to know that's not realistic. \n\nAs a woman, the risk of pregnancy is entirely resting on your wife's shoulders. If she gets pregnant, its HER body that will change. Its HER body that would undergo an abortion if that's what you two decided. Its HER body that would have to go through pregnancy and labor and delivery. Its HER body that would gain weight. Its HER body that would swell to produce breastmilk. Its HER body that might not feel like it's actually her body for months or years if a pregnancy occurs. If you guys are 100% certain that you don't want kids now, then I think doubling up with birth control pills and condoms is the responsible thing to do. If you definitely didn't want kids at all ever, I would suggest one or both of you get sterilized. But since you are undecided if you want them in the future, then doubling up is the most responsible decision you can make. A lot of people who don't use their preferred method of birth control are so distracted by worrying about the possible risks from sex that they can't even enjoy it, and then why even have sex in the first place if you're just gonna worry about it the whole time? I'm assuming you still orgasm from sex with a condom on, and the cleanup is infinitely quicker and less messy, AND it gives added peace of mind to your wife which I promise helps her be more engaged and enjoy it more, so other than not being able to talk about how cool it is that you can raw dog your wife, why is it such a drag to wear a condom?\n\nYou are ABSOLUTELY 100% entitled to feel however you are feeling. You had an expectation that stuff would be different and that didn't happen and that's unfortunate and disappointing, sure. But its not a tragedy, and realistically nothing has changed in your relationship and your wife probably has realized that. You've been together 7 years, your entire adult lives. I'm assuming you lived together prior to getting married, and you definitely were sexually active prior to getting married, so other than a piece of paper and possibly a last name change for one of you, what has fundamentally changed about your relationship now that you're married? You didn't want kids before you got married, so she took the pill and you were condoms. You still don't want kids after you got married, so she is still taking the pill and  you should still be wearing condoms. \n\nI don't think she lied to you. I just think she had different expectations for how your relationship would change after marriage. She probably (like a lot of people) felt like after you guys got married that it would feel like this massive immovable unbreakable permanent bond, because that's how marriage is portrayed a lot of the time, and that when that groundbreaking \"change\" took place in your relationship by getting married, then she would be comfortable not having a backup method of birth control. But your relationship didn't change just because you got married. It was already committed and loving and happy and all the things a marriage should be. So if she wasn't comfortable going without a condom before you signed a piece of paper, it isn't surprising to me that she realized she's still not comfortable with it now. \n\nWhile you're disappointed right now that nothing changed, keep in mind that *nothing changed*! Nothing got worse for you after marriage. Nothing is different now than it was before. Its not like you have to adjust to a new lifestyle or anything like that. And don't listen to anyone who tells you that you're missing out by staying with your wife even though she's being responsible and insisting on condoms. If you weren't married and weren't with your wife anymore and instead were running around wild and free, you would still be wearing condoms to protect against unplanned pregnancy, as well as STDs. So nothing has changed in your relationship or sex life with your wife, and if you left her over this, you'd still end up wearing condoms anyways with whoever else you found to sleep with, or you would life in perpetual fear of STDs and accidental babies.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I am dying laughing at these people commenting like having sex with your wife with a condom is the absolute WORST THING EVERRRRR and is a divorceable event.

And you should stay open to it being a marriage breaker. \n\nShe knew if she promised natural sex \\*\\*after\\*\\* marriage that she'd be able to get you to marry her.\n\nShe also knew if she told you the truth that the only time youre ever having natural sex is when youre trying for a baby, you might have thought twice. A long and faithful marriage is beautiful but how is this going to work?!? 1 day she wants to have a baby. You have natural sex for two months, then she gets pregnant and after that its back to using condoms again for the rest of your life? Thats not a healthy sex life.\n\nSmall lies lead to big lies....I wouldn't even call this a small lie.\n\nSexual compatibility is extremely important in a faithful marriage. So is honesty and so is compromise. The fact u've been with this girl since you were 17/18 (also sounds like she might be the only girl u've been with?) is probably part of the reason you think this isnt a big deal. \n\nHaving sex without a condom isn't just \"nicer\". I remember having sex without a condom after two years of strictly condoms and it was like having sex again for the first time. Completely different experience. Imagine eating a steak and wrapping your tongue in saran wrap. Thats what having sex with a condom feels like. This sub is mostly women so that's why so many comments are trying to tell youre stupid for thinking condomless sex is important. Theres a reason this has been on your mind so much. Because what shes asking of you isnt normal!\n\nThe comments here saying \"just use a condom or she wont let you have sex at all\" is sad. A 25 year old married man shouldnt be left begging for permission to have conditional sex with his queen!\n\nIf this was just some girlfriend, it would be no issue, but this is your WIFE. The woman you will be spending every night with for the rest of your life. I love being married, but if my wife tried to tell me I had to wear a condom forever, I don't think our marriage would have lasted very long.\n\nSince youre already married there's no easy solution here. But you can let her know you are serious and that using condoms as a lifelong couple is not normal. Somethings you can try:\n\n* Sit down with her and explain to her that you dislike sex with condoms and if she is really willing to make you do that for the rest of your life. Explain sex is important to you and hoped you would have a healthy sex life in marriage. Tell her youre upset that she lied to you about it. Her answers will tell you a lot about whether this marriage is really a partnership to her or if its just about her first and you second.\n* Stop having sex. Use your extra time and energy to work out, take up a new hobby, join the gym, turn your attention elsewhere to things that will be more enjoyable (I'll be honest, I would much rather go to the beach and go waterskiing than have sex with a condom). If she wants sex to be enjoyable for you again she will compromise. If she doesnt care she won't. If it turns out she doesnt care, think about whether she is the right person for you to spend the next 70 years with. (Don't ignore your wife, you can and should include her in these new activities).\n* Tell her (don't ask) that youre getting a vasectomy so you can have sex without a condom. You can even go get some pamphlets or something to show her youre serious. Tell her youre a married man and youre not going to spend the rest of your life wrapping your dick in a silicon bag. She might realize you arent willing to be pushed over and will compromise. Some commenters are saying you are stupid for being willing to let your wife go over something like this. Well, is she willing to let you go over it? \n* If she does not want you to have a vasectomy, ask her to get an IUD and you will use spermcide, and she is on the pill. If she still gets pregnant after that, she would be the 8th wonder of the world. Fear of getting pregnant isn't a rational excuse. These newer birth control methods are superior to condoms in every way.\n\nThe wife's happiness is extremely important in a marriage. But the husband's is equally so. Marriage is a long time. Make sure she's the right one.
