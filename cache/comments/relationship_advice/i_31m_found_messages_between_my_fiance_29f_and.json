Who she told me that she blocked early on in our relationship, and here I see text messages between her and him..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I guess I went too far back. I am not going to lie, I went back into the chat history and now I am RIDICULOUSLY HURT. \n\nI will just give you guys the timeline based on what happened. The pieces aren't all together because definitely they talked over snapchat as well. And from what she told me about him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I came along she was hooking up with this guy call him Robert. She told me that he was a guy that she stuck with because he had so many problems and she was addicted to helping him out. Supposedly he had some issues with adderall and keeping a job, and that was her excuse why she was with him. \n\nFrom what I saw over text messages... the main reason she was with him was because this guy was huge. I saw videos of him... and to make matters worse she sent him VIDEOS too which she never has sent to me despite me asking (She says ladies don't do that). Also they were never 'dating dating' they were just hooking up and not only that he would just text her at random hours and she would excitedly come over... Also too this guy was doing this with A LOT OF women. \n\nI come in the picture, turns out my girlfriend tries to use me to make him jealous. He laughs at my haircut and clothing says that I dress out of a clearance rack. While we were dating and even boyfriend girlfriend, my girlfriend told me she wasn't ready to sleep with me. She says that she needs to make sure that a guy is right for her before she can do that, and that she isn't like other girls... ALL The while this guy would text her hey come over I get off early from my dentist appointment and she would leave work early for him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw from messages again hard to know details but basically she told him that if he isn't going to be serious with her she will date me. And he told her to go ahead.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's when we started dating. he texted her sometimes when we were together but the conversations were just like quick life updates no talking...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to say. It seems that my relationship and everything with her was a lie that I was just a backup plan while she had her heart to this other guy. Look I knew full well and before that she messaged this guy time to time I saw some of them before. But to me I thought oh my girlfriend is super caring and wouldn't want this guy to be on the streets or to hurt himself. But in reality it was all a lie. It pisses me off so much that I was the backup. And look its one thing early on in dating, when you don't know someone's personality etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to me it really seemed like I was the clearance bin backup. (No I don't shop at the clearance bin) I don't know what to do here. I want to be happy with her I want to be married. I know she didn't message or sleep with him two months (at least what I saw).\n\nI am hurt, I am pissed off that while she is telling me all this stuff about how she doesn't get into bed quickly with guys, she is at his house at 3pm. I am so hurt its not just oh I am the backup. It's like she is a completely different woman with this guy than she is with me. With me she is super lady like super strict boundaries. With him is like whatever goes. And its ridiculous. We went to Spain last year, and she was upset that I made her pay for the hotel because in her eyes she was raised to be treated a 'certain way by men.' But for this guy she would be the one buying him food all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't even know how confronting her would even work now. She and her sister are living in our shared apartment together. If I confront her this would lead to a break up and I don't even know what to do. My family members have been gotten VISAs for our wedding and now it seems like its all down the drain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do? Do I tell her I saw what she posted on her macbook? Or should I try to guess her to confess? Also is it a good idea to screenshot the messages and send to myself so I can keep for proof? I feel that things could get ugly with her family. Her mom doesn't like me because she see's me as dark skin. What is next? Also I will answer whatever parts are necessary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tl;Dr- I found out that I was the backup guy for my girlfriend when things with her and her ex didn't workout.

Kick her out and call off the wedding. Try and get refunds if you made deposits but I&#39;m not sure how that works. Talk to someone who does.</li>\n<li>Go NO CONTACT! After you break up,DO NOT ENGAGE with her IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. She will use every opportunity to try an manipulate you into changing your mind and messing with your head. Always remember she&#39;s not sorry for hurting you, she&#39;s sorry she was caught and her backup has fallen through.
