Frankly, it kinda seems like he\u2019s an argumentative personality all around, but now that you\u2019re the only person he has access to most of the time, he\u2019s taking it out on you. Some people just feel the need to argue for the sake of it. Often, these people also are unwilling to even consider that they\u2019re wrong about anything.\n\nWhich is to say... I\u2019m not sure couples therapy would help. It sounds like a negative personality trait that HE has, and that you have tried to work around the issue in more or less every way without any improvement on his part. If that\u2019s accurate and he is naturally argumentative, it seems unlikely he would be willing to accept anything a therapist of any kind says to him. \n\nHonestly, maybe you should consider some sort of short-term separation; being cooped up together for so long can put a lot of strain on a couple. When I say separate short-term, I mean in some structured way. Like maybe agreeing on a certain date, 30 days later or whatever, at which point you meet up and talk about how that time was for each of you and whether or not you think you\u2019re ready to live together again. Then either try that or spend more time apart if you need to. \n\nAlso, if you do try that, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to mean you\u2019re cut off from each other. Maybe you\u2019ll still communicate during separation, maybe not - the terms of how it\u2019ll happen IF it happens are yours to make.\n\nI know the idea of taking any step at all that might seem like it opens you up to the possibility of the relationship ending is terrifying. Plus, if you have children, I know that changes things. This is just my advice, and may be an option worth consideration.

Frankly, it kinda seems like he\u2019s an argumentative personality all around, but now that you\u2019re the only person he has access to most of the time, he\u2019s taking it out on you. Some people just feel the need to argue for the sake of it. Often, these people also are unwilling to even consider that they\u2019re wrong about anything.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say... I\u2019m not sure couples therapy would help. It sounds like a negative personality trait that HE has, and that you have tried to work around the issue in more or less every way without any improvement on his part. If that\u2019s accurate and he is naturally argumentative, it seems unlikely he would be willing to accept anything a therapist of any kind says to him. </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, maybe you should consider some sort of short-term separation; being cooped up together for so long can put a lot of strain on a couple. When I say separate short-term, I mean in some structured way. Like maybe agreeing on a certain date, 30 days later or whatever, at which point you meet up and talk about how that time was for each of you and whether or not you think you\u2019re ready to live together again. Then either try that or spend more time apart if you need to. </p>\n\n<p>Also, if you do try that, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to mean you\u2019re cut off from each other.
