Like \u201cI won\u2019t look at her social media at all for a week\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to go out with friends and not talk about the things I miss.\u201d Keep building on them, and eventually you can get to \u201cI\u2019ll go out tonight and be open to meeting someone\u201d (if that\u2019s what you want). </p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no getting around the fact that this will sting for some time\u2014 but at the end of the day, neither of you can really be happy if one partner isn\u2019t fully invested in the relationship. You had a loving relationship, and you will be able to find another one. Good luck!</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gja4l8/how_to_survive_a_breakup_you_didnt_see_coming_25m/fqknhnr/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqknhnr", "created": 1589460134.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589431334.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gja4l8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqkxcvw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "Trais333", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gja4l8", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_a5928", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "body": "Same man, I\u2019m two months is and it\u2019s a little better now.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Same man, I\u2019m two months is and it\u2019s a little better now.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gja4l8/how_to_survive_a_breakup_you_didnt_see_coming_25m/fqkxcvw/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqkxcvw", "created": 1589467925.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589439125.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gja4l8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqm7o48", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "WesternRidge", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gja4l8", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_j7yji9h", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "body": "People saying \"time is the only way\" are right, but here's another way to think about it: you have to become a different person to really get over her.
