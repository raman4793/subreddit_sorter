Give her a safe space. Talk to her often. Don\u2019t ask direct questions. Let her trust you. Let her talk, vent and confide. Do not pressure her. Do not vilify or praise her father. Be a confidant. Share your \u2018secrets\u2019 with her. </p>\n\n<p>The behaviors you expressed are grooming behaviors. All you can do without proof is be a safe space and an outlet for her when she is ready to talk. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t like to talk about my past but over the 10 years I suffered I confided in people that I didn\u2019t think had the ability to blow up my life. I denied and deflected the suspicions of people who asked me direct questions. It was too much pressure and fear for me when I was a child. Remember, if you\u2019re talking to a victim:</p>\n\n<p>They may not know whether or not this is normal.\nThey may not know anyone is in their corner.\nThey may feel shame or responsibility for what happens to them.\nThey may be afraid of what will happen to their family. They may fear no one will believe them. \nThey may have been threatened with all sorts of evils should they let the behaviors against them be known.\nThey may deny the truth point blank to your face.</p>\n\n<p>I wish you and yours all the best. Thank you for having open eyes. Too many people are too quick to look away for fear of rocking the boat.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj3kp1/im_worried_my_nieces_dad_is_a_sexual_predator/fqjhzot/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqjhzot", "created": 1589438999.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589410199.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj3kp1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqjlduh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "SMW1984", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gj3kp1", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_2gp0oese", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "body": "You are not being paranoid.

Im not accusing him of doing anything explicitly wrong (from a legal perspective) However, I know for a fact he is doing something wrong from a moral and emotional standpoint. I have this thread to thank for putting a label on something I didn\u2019t quite understand before my post. His predatory behavior is called grooming. He groomed me. He groomed many girls in the youth group (they have opened up to me and shared their stories) He IS a predator. Perhaps he hasn\u2019t done anything illegal, but his behavior is worrisome, and indisputably inappropriate. I hope/ pray he never has (and never will) cross the line between creepy and criminal.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj3kp1/im_worried_my_nieces_dad_is_a_sexual_predator/fqk8e2w/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqk8e2w", "created": 1589450931.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589422131.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqk6n40", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "RecklessSand", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqk02z6", "score": -1, "author_fullname": "t2_163nyx", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "body": "Sounds like you only want to hear from people that agree with you.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Sounds like you only want to hear from people that agree with you.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj3kp1/im_worried_my_nieces_dad_is_a_sexual_predator/fqk6n40/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqk6n40", "created": 1589449962.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589421162.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -2, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj3kp1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gj3kp1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqk8v3q", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "tthrowaway123423", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqk4aks", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_6gtf5u2c", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "collapsed": false, "body": "Read my comment above.
