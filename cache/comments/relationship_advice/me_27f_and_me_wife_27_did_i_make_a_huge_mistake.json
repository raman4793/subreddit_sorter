My wife and I have been together for 10 years and it hasn't always been smooth.  Over a year into our relationship, my depression got really bad and I broke up with her. We never really cut much contact, and I still saw her often, but I was in a bad place.  She ended up dating a guy she worked with during the summer for a month or so, and we stayed in contact the whole time.  I told her I wanted her back, and she said she broke up with the guy. We were leaving for college together that fall.  The day before we left I found out they never broke up at all.  \n\n\nDrama drama drama, we still go to school together and talk it out. We get back together. I had my suspicions that they were still together, but I really wanted to be with her. About 2 weeks into the semester, I was at her dorm and saw a weird stain on the sheets.  She kept dodging the question about what it was, and then finally said she had spilled some cheese out of her lunch and didn't change the sheets afterward.  I also found an open pack of condoms, but she claimed her mother had given them to her (very likely) and a floor mate needed one. I'm still not sure when she and the guy actually broke up.  \n\n\nThe next semester, a mutual friend was reminiscing about the Homecoming game, and let it slip that my wife had been there with her boyfriend when she had told me she returned home that weekend and hadn't answered her phone at all.  We worked through that though, because I had already known she was with him at the beginning of the semester.  It wasn't until YEARS later, when my wife was pregnant with our child, that she finally admitted that yes, it was in fact, cum on the bed sheets.  Obviously, I got upset, but what could I do at that point? She was having a baby we made together, and we had already been \\*married\\* for 3 years.  \n\n\nLately, I've felt less secure and passionate in our relationship.  Nothing else really has happened that I know of, and this change is all on me.  If anything, my wife loves me more now than she ever has, but I just don't feel the same anymore.  I always wanted someone to \\*choose\\* me, if that makes sense.  I feel like she settled for me in the end, when I only ever wanted her.  We haven't had sex in nearly a month because I just.. can't feel intimate that way with her.  I keep thinking about all the lies toward the beginning of our relationship... I feel manipulated into having this life.  But.. it's been years, and I don't think it would be right to leave now.  We have two kids, we're trying to buy a house, I'm a stay-at-home-mom with no income of my own.  If I did leave, I'd have no where to go.  \n\n\nI hate my life. I love my kids, but they are the only thing about my life that I enjoy. What can I do? Should we try counseling? If I bring all this up... how will she react? Am I being petty for feeling this way only now? I'm normally a very passionate person.  My mom always joked that I have a soapbox in my back pocket, because I can never just have an opinion. I take a stand. I have always showered my wife with love and tenderness, but lately it's been a struggle just to cuddle with her.  She knows somethings wrong.  She can feel I'm pulling away, and she is getting angry and sad.  I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm destroying our marriage over ancient history\n\nEdit:: even though I found out about her lies about 3 years ago, these feelings are resurfacing now because we recently got into an ugly fight when she accused me of cheating. I have never cheated, and she reacted so hostility over absolutely nothing, part of me feels a bit indignant about it.  After the accusation, I started to pull away.  I never treated her that badly even when she DID cheat on me, so it makes me feel like I'm held to a significantly higher standard for loving her than she has for herself when it comes to loving me.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Me (27f) and me wife (27) did I make a huge mistake?
