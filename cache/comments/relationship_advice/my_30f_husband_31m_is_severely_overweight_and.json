He's 6'0\" and last time he willingly told me his weight he was 295. I managed to convince him to go to a doctor (we now share the same family doctor) and he was started on weightloss medication. He goes through this period where he'll get it filled, take it until he runs out, and then put off getting it filled. To be fair, it is expensive AF and not covered, but I usually have to really nudge him to get it filled. So far he has half a month left at the pharmacy and hasn't had it filled. It's probably been a month.  (Quick edit: Sorry, it is an appetite suppression pill, not specifically weight loss.)\n\nTwo nights ago he told me he needs to start weighing himself everyday. I thought, great, progress! He wants to hold himself accountable. Yesterday he told me he ordered something that would be in at noon (he works a very stressful job, usually nights, so he sleeps during the day.) my heart fell because I thought maybe he'd ordered fast food, which is his easy go-to meal. Noon comes around and I check the front door. He's ordered two 1 liter things of ice cream from Marble Slab (basically a \"pick your ice cream, pick your mixings, we will put it together.\") I was a little worried because that's a big temptation, but after he talked about watching his weight, I thought maybe he would try to control it. Keep in mind this was yesterday.\n\nThis morning I get up with our son and give him a quick breakfast downstairs. The one liter container is empty on the living room table.\n\nMy husband can have a very short fuse. He's an amazing husband and provider, but doesn't handle being criticized well (not in the rage sort of way, but in the \"I've just had one of my personal weaknesses made obvious to me and I feel shame\" sort of way.) I need to stress that I've never felt unsafe or like I can't talk to him about it. We communicate well, and it's been a long road getting here. I've had to learn how to not be as blunt, which has been good for me, because blunt isn't always the way to go with people like my husband.\n\nHusband comes downstairs and I ask him, I think, sort of sadly, if he ate the whole liter last night? His back is immediately up. He tells me no and raises his voice to me (not yelling though) \"Don't look at me like that\". I say \"We just got that yesterday\" while he puts on his shoes and goes outside, slams the door behind him.\n\nI finish feeding kidlet and come upstairs to post this.\n\nHere are some relevant facts:\n\nHis dad is SUPER unhealthy. History of cancer, pre-diabetic (which I believe is now just regular diabetic.) Husband is very sedentary, plays a lot of games, sits at work or is at a standing desk. Yesterday he spent a good portion of the day napping (coming off a night shift and now in self-isolation), or playing games. I managed to get him to go outside to play with our son but it couldn't have been more than 15 minutes because they were back inside by the time I came home. We share a family doctor.\n\nHe is a good man, and a good father, but I am scared shitless that I am going to be a young widow at this point. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to convince him that he needs to get a control of this. I'm sure this is an eating disorder of some kind but I have no idea how to broach the topic or where to go for help. I have to go back to see our family doctor in a few weeks so I can talk about it with him then, but... I'm just scared I'm going to lose him. I'm scared for my son, because my husband loves him SO much and I don't want my son to lose that. Any advice or help would be very appreciated.\n\nWe're in Canada, so if anyone has resources that our country specific, well, there you go.\n\n(He is also 100% against the idea of therapy or counseling.

My father recently passed away from complications related to type II diabetes.\n\nThis is a lifelong struggle, and it is hard.  So I have developed a strategy for me to win.  It may not work for you husband but I'll give you the overall outline here.\n\n1. \"I will suffer now by eating less, but I will suffer more later by eating more.\"\n\nThis is the guiding principle.  I had to replace the natural positive reinforcement of eating something now with the knowledge that I was HURTING myself.  You can't reason your way out of it.  Even if you think \"I can make up for this later by eating less or exercise\" that's not quite right, because you could just eat less now or exercise now.  So you will suffer more later.\n\n2) The website is old, but frankly this is the best diet for this type of guy.  [https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/)\n\nIt's called the Hacker's Diet and if he follows it by weighing daily (as he said he would), setting a goal, and eating less he will get there.  Now, it is actually easier to count calories these days with something like MyFitnessPal, so that could be a strategy, but I found it sticks better to just try to minimize intake (while still eating enough) and remind myself of the guiding principle.\n\n3) The main thing any \"fad\" diet does is cut out sugar.  Cut out the refined sugar.  The emptiest of calories with the least amount of satisfaction.  I do find the satiety index useful for picking foods to make me suffer less.

I peaked at 6' 265 lbs, which isn't as far gone as your husband, but it's the same struggle.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: The \"apple rule\" is very good. Are you hungry enough to eat an apple?

Even if you think &quot;I can make up for this later by eating less or exercise&quot; that&#39;s not quite right, because you could just eat less now or exercise now.  So you will suffer more later.</p>\n\n<p>2) The website is old, but frankly this is the best diet for this type of guy.  <a href=\"https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/\">https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s called the Hacker&#39;s Diet and if he follows it by weighing daily (as he said he would), setting a goal, and eating less he will get there.  Now, it is actually easier to count calories these days with something like MyFitnessPal, so that could be a strategy, but I found it sticks better to just try to minimize intake (while still eating enough) and remind myself of the guiding principle.</p>\n\n<p>3) The main thing any &quot;fad&quot; diet does is cut out sugar.  Cut out the refined sugar.  The emptiest of calories with the least amount of satisfaction.  I do find the satiety index useful for picking foods to make me suffer less.  <a href=\"http://ernaehrungsdenkwerkstatt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/EDWText/TextElemente/Ernaehrungswissenschaft/Naehrstoffe/Saettigung_Lebensmittel_Satiety_Index.pdf\">http://ernaehrungsdenkwerkstatt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/EDWText/TextElemente/Ernaehrungswissenschaft/Naehrstoffe/Saettigung_Lebensmittel_Satiety_Index.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m currently 6&#39; 220 lbs.  I peaked at 6&#39; 265 lbs, which isn&#39;t as far gone as your husband, but it&#39;s the same struggle.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT TO ADD: The &quot;apple rule&quot; is very good. Are you hungry enough to eat an apple?  Ok, eat an apple.  Is the apple not going to do it for you? Just don&#39;t eat, it&#39;s a craving, not hunger.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/gizzg2/my_30f_husband_31m_is_severely_overweight_and/fqiq7yn/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqiq7yn", "created": 1589428202.0, "author_flair_text": "Late 30s Male", "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589399402.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gizzg2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqirqku", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "cactus227", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gizzg2", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4hq8ck0k", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "body": "This happened to my uncle.

Simply put it's changed my life. I've lost about 30 pounds since that time without starving or depriving myself of food. But I've managed to keep to a 1200 calorie diet. It works on many levels. It teaches you about calorie density and has you track your meals and snacks (but it's really easy to do) and walks you through a bit of food psychology every day. It's about 20 minutes of reading. It encourages exercise but it's not at all the focus of the program. My husband who is barely overweight has lost 10 pounds just by eating my tweaked meals (mostly just using brown rice and whole wheat pasta for example).\n\nWho cooks the meals in the house? What is made? Why does he turn to fast food? I know it must be difficult with a toddler running around but cooking with healthy ingredients will ultimately be very helpful.

It works on many levels. It teaches you about calorie density and has you track your meals and snacks (but it&#39;s really easy to do) and walks you through a bit of food psychology every day. It&#39;s about 20 minutes of reading. It encourages exercise but it&#39;s not at all the focus of the program.

You know that feeling of guilt?\n\nWe're conditionned by society and the whole diet culture to feel bad everytime we dont eat 'well'. And fat people are shamed everyday, everywhere, in subtles and not so subtles ways. I'm just saying, be kind to your husband, and dont add to that.
