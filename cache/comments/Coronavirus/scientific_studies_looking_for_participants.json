Homeschooling, social distancing, and confinement, as a result of COVID-19, exert specific stresses on parents related to eating and feeding patterns. For parents, homeschooling can mean needing to provide more meals than usual, while trying to work from home, and increased emotional eating and snaking as they try to regulate their own eating. For children, the changes in daily routines is disrupting to eating patterns. For everyone, decreased opportunities for physical exercise are disruptive to weight control behaviors. In these circumstances, parents face a unique set of challenges. Our preliminary findings indicate that in the current situation, most families are cooking and eating more meals together than usual, with 66% of families reporting eating more home prepared meals more than before. However, almost 40% also reported being more worried about preparing meals, and 25% reported not having enough energy or time to cook meals for their children. In addition, parents indicate struggling to provide healthy family meals, and helping children establish regular eating patterns with some children displaying more picky eating, as well as emotional eating themselves, and snacking out of anxiety or boredom. Finally, over 50% of parent reported using social media to find information related to feeding their child suggesting that an online and mobile resource would be very helpful.\n\nBuilding on these preliminary findings, the next step of our work will involve developing an online resource that can be quickly disseminated to provide support and guidance around eating for families. The process of developing the resource will be collaborative with parents, using their identified challenges as a guide in conjunction with our knowledge of how to foster healthy eating strategies for parents and young children, and wellbeing. Specifically, we will (1) conduct interviews to explore in depth areas of challenge that have come to light through or online survey as well as perceived needs; (2) work to develop an initial version online and mobile resource that can be quickly disseminated to parents; (3) obtain feedback from parents and refine the resource; (4) disseminate the resource and evaluate its acceptability as well as how helpful it is in support parents in maintaining healthy eating in their family during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Study Link:** https://tinyurl.com/HomeEating\n\n**Disclaimer (ethical/legal):** This study was approved by the Northeastern University IRB (#18-11-12).\n\n**End Date:** October 15, 2020", "edited": 1587065362.0, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Northeastern University, Department of Communication &amp; Disorders</p>\n\n<p><strong>Study Title:</strong> Kids Eat Well@Home: An Online Mobile Platform for Parents to Increase Healthy Eating and Feeding during COVID-19</p>\n\n<p><strong>Study Description:</strong> Eating patterns and behaviors are critical contributors to health and wellbeing.
