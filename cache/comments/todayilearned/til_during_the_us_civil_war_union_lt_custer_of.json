I cannot say I entirely agree, but it was written without venom and I can see that. I know the history of it, but I also know you can't judge historical characters with modern morality, hence the fact many remember Vlad the Impaler as a hero. For this reason, I overlook much of the civil war itself as it was in a different age, with men still alive from the country's founding (albeit few). So, I don't associate it in itself with shame as much as I do the KKK and the vile acts that were done in the Jim Crow era that feels as though it occurred just a few decades ago. In many ways, I find those times to be the failure of reconstruction. The affinity for the flag is difficult to describe, but I also understand the repulsion from it better now.

It didn't, but Black people had a few minutes in the sun, and then got shoved right back under the stairs until after WWII. So, the flag is there representing the culture? The culture of what? \"Make sure black folks know why we fought, and what we will do to them now if they step out of line?\" You can't separate that from that flag. That's part of the culture. It's not right.  It hearkens to memories of home because it represents the south. Why? Why is it there? To defy the union? No. No, it made its comeback in the 20th century as a reaction to federal government ending segregation.  And it's time for good southerners to lay it down.\n\nThe confederacy was fueled by slavery. The States declared this when they declared their independence from the Union.

These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they had won, then slavery would have won. There is no way around it. When the Confederate armies crossed into the north, they re-enslaved the free blacks they came across. Did you know that? The Army of Northern Virginia on its way to Gettysburg captured black people, escaped slave or free, and brought them back down south in their retreat.\n\nThe shame is unspeakable. That was Robert E. Lee's army. That's what they fought for. It is a fact. None of the glory of the Confederate infantry or cavalry is worth that.\n\nSouthern gentility, and southern accents all predate the war, they survived the war.

Mostly.\n\nPeople do kick the south, and Southerners, and they are vicious and hateful about it. It's not worse than other types of hate I have seen. Southerness isn't a death sentence in most of the US. Unless you're in a ghetto somewhere. And that's no surprise. Why? What good could that flag and the culture venerating it mean to someone who would be a slave under it?\n\nYou are right that southern racism is different than northern racism. I lived in Detroit for 5 years before I left the US. I have never seen racist, vicious hatred like I did there. Stupid hate. Stereotypical. Like what Hollywood writes about the south even though they have no clue. And no records of past individual stupid hate are as vicious to me as the Chicago protests against MLK jr's marches there.\n\nBUT the South has so much to live down, George Lee,  Lamar Smith, Emmett Till, Bill Edwards, Bill Moore, Medgar Evers, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley, James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Henry Schwerner, Viola Gregg Liuzzo, Vernon Dahmer, Samuel Ephesians Hammond Jr., Delano Herman Middleton, Henry Ezekial Smith. There are so many more. And the south does not own up to it. We do not face it. We do not take responsibility for it.\n\nAnd all the glory of the Confederate Infantry and their fight, all that culture, is not worth the lives of 4 little girls in Birmingham Alabama. Blown up in church. Little. Girls.\n\nMy God. Why? Because black people wanted to vote? To ride the bus? To be people? Cause they were 'uppity?'\n\nNo. To hell with it all.\n\nThe north is stupid and vicious in their hate of the south, and racially as well. Maybe it's just how they do things. The south is genteel about many things (the new south excepted, they are as bad as Chicago) but still racist. It's just more polite. That doesn't make a difference if you are black and can't get a damned leg up anywhere you go.\n\nThat flag that you are defending here, was the flag of men fighting to keep other Americans, honorable Americans, in chains.
