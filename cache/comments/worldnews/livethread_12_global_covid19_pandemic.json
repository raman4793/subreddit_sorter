Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that they will wear one (76% versus 59%), according to a recent poll. Wearing one signals that you believe in science; that you believe in putting the greater good ahead of your individual comfort. To some people, they are a sign of solidarity; to others, they signify that you are a liberal snowflake. They have become the opposite of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps.\n\n(searches thru silver linings stash)  \n\nOh yeah, this will help put a funny spin during wildfires.\n\n> This may soon change. While Trump conspicuously eschews masks \u2013 he reportedly told advisers that wearing one would \u201csend the wrong message\u201d \u2013 his campaign **never misses a monetisation opportunity**. Last week, Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, shared a photo in which he was wearing a **Maga mask** with a caption announcing that there were \u201cmore coming soon!\u201d Knowing Trump, his masks will probably be made in China.\n\n... .. .  OK, someone convince Trump that there's money to be made in bicycles, household biodigesters, turning lawns into food forests and other sustainable-prepping goodies.  *Water catchments ftw!*\n\nC'mon, Trump.  Let's face it, this pandemic's forcing people to think more about sustainable stuff like growing our own food.  *The hotel industry is gonna be not shiny industry for quite some time...*  But c'mon, there are other business opportunities everywhere.

Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that they will wear one (76% versus 59%), according to a recent poll. Wearing one signals that you believe in science; that you believe in putting the greater good ahead of your individual comfort. To some people, they are a sign of solidarity; to others, they signify that you are a liberal snowflake. They have become the opposite of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(searches thru silver linings stash)  </p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, this will help put a funny spin during wildfires.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This may soon change.
