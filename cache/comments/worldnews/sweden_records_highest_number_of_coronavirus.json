Will edit my post to reflect that.</p>\n\n<p>I found the numbers for Covid-19 on <a href=\"https://portal.icuregswe.org/siri/report/corona.alderkon\">this link</a>, you will need to manually select region Stockholm in order to see the data. I think it&#39;s up to 135 today, which makes sense since all numbers in the above post (deaths and ICU cases) are from the beginning of this month.</p>\n\n<p>Edit again: I double checked my numbers, and it&#39;s still a bit off. I can&#39;t remember what date it was I collected them, so I will go back through my browsing history later today and double-check again.</p>\n\n<p>Second edit: Just gone through some browsing history and some email convos, I think that the error is that it should be the 80+ age group, not the 70+ age group.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "worldnews", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gja94u/sweden_records_highest_number_of_coronavirus/fql3zqy/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fql3zqy", "created": 1589474239.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fql3ndf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": "kigurai", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fql2s04", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_7hwoy", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "collapsed": false, "body": "I'm not sure where you can see data from last week, but given that the number from today shows that about 500 people over the age of 70 have been treated at ICU, I think your number of 65 is bogus.\n\n [https://www.icuregswe.org/data--resultat/covid-19-i-svensk-intensivvard/](https://www.icuregswe.org/data--resultat/covid-19-i-svensk-intensivvard/)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not sure where you can see data from last week, but given that the number from today shows that about 500 people over the age of 70 have been treated at ICU, I think your number of 65 is bogus.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icuregswe.org/data--resultat/covid-19-i-svensk-intensivvard/\">https://www.icuregswe.org/data--resultat/covid-19-i-svensk-intensivvard/</a></p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "worldnews", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gja94u/sweden_records_highest_number_of_coronavirus/fql3ndf/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fql3ndf", "created": 1589473901.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589445101.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_fqmbp2y", "id": "fqmbp2y", "parent_id": "t1_fql2s04", "depth": 4, "children": ["fqmbp2y", "fqlxkrq"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fql2s04", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": "thegreger", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqkv6n8", "score": 17, "author_fullname": "t2_abzh2", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "body": "I wouldn't say that we succeded in that.\n\nWhen I checked a little more than a week ago, there were 65 people over the age of (edit) 80 who had recieved ICU (edit) in Region Stockholm, since the start of the pandemic.
