So a month later after that I hit her up and she replied still down to talk. \n\nWe have a decent conversation and I manage to get her number. We text a bit and I ask her out and she said yes. \n\nI was pretty excited and nervous as I have been having trouble asking girls out since forever. But I did it.

I think I asked her whats the \"this dates going bad word\"  and she said pineapple. Not exactly sure on this part my memory is hazy and I'm kind of pessimistic about dating, blame my bad self esteen.\n\nAnyways dates ended she says we should do it again and we go back to texting. Her texting is really bad at this point. So I ask her out again, she reccomends a day which sounds like good news. She later rescheduled it and the date happened.\n\nMore talking this time at a sunset. Now I'm not expecting much but it just felt like we were conversating. No attraction or anything no meaningful physical contact.  \n\nAnyways quick side story is that she told me she has a crazy roommate whose name is pronounced the same way as her. And he's very weird does things like puts cigarettes in her purse and asks if he could smoke one even tho they are his.\n\nAnyways later on in the date as things are winding down she checks in with her friend and said pineapple. And I'm like \"oh no are things going bad\". But then she says nah her roommate was talking about pineapple seeds or something.  She said the actual word is Armando Frank which sounded made up on the spot and on Google it comes up as a black dude who got killed by cops, which is honestly pretty insensitive since I'm black lol.\n\nAnyways after that she says some drama is starting up with her crazy roommate and her roommates and she has to go. So I pay most of the check and split some of it as I paid the all of the first day. I told her she can venmo me her portion.\n\nAnyways i drop her off head home and text her that I had a great time. She says  pretty much \"same\". Then I went to bed. This was all yesterday. \n\nToday I've still got no venmo notification, I've texted her good morning and so far no reply.

I mean she did say she smokes cigarettes but stopped but the story of her roommate putting cigarettes in her purse to ask for them just seems so bizarre. \n\nSorry for the long story\n\nAtleast I know I can talk to girls that I am interested in so kind of got over that fear.\n\n\nEDIT: Although I'll admit asking a girl what their \"this is a terrible dare word\" seems like a bad idea not like you should expect the true word", "edited": 1589486899.0, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A good week but also bad week for me I guess kind of a long story.</p>\n\n<p>Months ago I matched with a girl and we talked for a bit before she ghosted me.

Don&#39;t know whether to drop her a message later or leave it.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Tinder", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Tinder/comments/ghwg7z/story_time_week_of_may_11_2020/fqm8lid/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqm8lid", "created": 1589502139.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589473339.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Tinder", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ghwg7z", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ghwg7z", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqmv43g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "seige_london", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqlx9j8", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_3haqoxu6", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2w7mz", "collapsed": false, "body": "Be honest and tell him; don\u2019t ghost.

We had been talking everyday for a month up until the day of her birthday, which was the only time we hungout in person. We had sext a few times up til this point and she tells me she wants to have sex as her birthday present. So I go over to her apartment as her roommates weren\u2019t going to be there so I decided to go over and have sex with her. After we finished having sex we are cuddled up in her bed just talking. She tells me she likes me and wants me to come over next week but she wants to invite her best friend over next time. So in my head I\u2019m like fuck yeah a threesome, but then she tells me her best friend is a guy and wants us to have a threesome. She continues to tell me that her best friend is gay and would be willing to eat my ass and give me a blowjob. Up to this point I\u2019m just like wtf is going on. I tell her No!! I don\u2019t want to get my ass ate and a blowjob from a dude. So she gets overly defensive saying that I hate gay people and that I should be more open minded to stuff like that. So I start getting dressed and as I\u2019m about to leave her apartment  she tells me if I\u2019m not willing to get my ass ate by her gay best friend then we can\u2019t hangout anymore.
