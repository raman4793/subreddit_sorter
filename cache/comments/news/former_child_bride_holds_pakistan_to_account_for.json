European countries are as strict as the US regarding this topic. The only differences are that the age of consent in  most countries goes as low as 14, and in Italy and Hungary it does down to 13 and 12.

At least in the US there are strict guidelines in most states for kids under 16.  In Europe similar guidelines on protect kids under 14 (and not even then, such as with Italy).\n\nYou're contradicting yourself here. Previously, you suggested that Europe's laws are less strict, now you're saying they are equally strict. \n\nHere's something that will blow your mind. Some US states allow teenagers under the age of 16 to have sex. Arkansas allows children under the age of 12 to have sex as long as the partner isn't more than 3 years older or younger. No European country allows this. There you wear screeching about Italy and its low age of consent of 13, while in Arkansas they can be under 12 years old. \n\nColorado's age of consent is under 15 as long as the partner is less than 4 years older. So a 10 year old can legally have sex with a 14 year old in Colorado. They also allow you to marry a child you raped so you can't be arrested for it \n\nConnecticut's age of consent is 13 as long as the partner is less than 3 years older.
