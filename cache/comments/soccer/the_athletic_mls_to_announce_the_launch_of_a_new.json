I can&#39;t tell which one you&#39;re describing.</p>\n\n<p>Here in Portugal every youth team plays in the same youth system that mimics the adult league system for each level (u15, u17 and u19), with a pyramid of tiered leagues. On the lower age groups you have the same pyramids but they are smaller and encompass only the local district instead of being nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>The top youth clubs in the country all play in the higher tiers for each youth level, these are usually the same as the top adult clubs, although there are exceptions. Good players starting out in the lower youth divisions will be scouted by better clubs in the area and join them moving up to the top youth division, much like in the adult competitions.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: As an example, take a player playing for CAC u17s in the suburbs of Lisbon. He&#39;s playing in the 3rd Division of the Lisbon u17 league system, and he&#39;s the star of the team. He&#39;s scouted by Damaiense from the same area which has been scouting local players, and he joins them in Lisbon&#39;s u17 1st Division. Afterwards he&#39;s scouted again by Casa Pia not very far from the first two clubs, and he joins them in the u17 National League where he&#39;ll face the best players in the country in his age group.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "soccer", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/soccer/comments/gj3klg/the_athletic_mls_to_announce_the_launch_of_a_new/fqlcrdf/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqlcrdf", "created": 1589482968.0, "author_flair_text": ":Sporting_Clube_de_Portug:", "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589454168.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fql708s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "d0mth0ma5", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fql4266", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5dbpj", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "body": "They\u2019re probably scouted at District/County level or equivalent.
