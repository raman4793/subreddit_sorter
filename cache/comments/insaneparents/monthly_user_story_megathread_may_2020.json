Mostly my mom.\n\n**Biggest rant I have been holding back for awhile:**\n\nFor a few years, I've been wanting to rant to someone about my parents. Never understood them, still don't. Been to therapy three times, it's not for me. So I coast through life with depression, anxiety, mild autism, mild schizophrenia, and BPD.\n\nActually, I don't. I just make those up. I over-exaggerated my emotions to my therapists and that's how I got those diagnosed. At least, that's what my mom says. All I am is a crybaby. A lazy crybaby.\n\nI live with my mom (my dad comes around sometimes) and let me just say.. she's two faced. If you're a guest, you will be treated with kindness. She will put up this wall hiding her bitchy side. Guests leave? It's never quiet in this house. All she does is find something to complain about. Doesn't have to be about you, she could complain about anything. Currently, she complains about this COVID-19 stuff.\n\n\"'SiX fEeT aPaRt.' Why isn't anyone staying six feet apart?\" mind you, she's never home. She's always out shopping somewhere. She goes to Walmart AT LEAST once a day. Then complains about social distancing with other and blames us (me and my youngest brother) as the reason why she's so broke. None of us asks her to go. She just goes.\n\n\"There's so much traffic wtf stay at home, everybody!\" yet, she contributes to the traffic. \"I'm special, I'm allowed to be out. I'm shopping.\" THIS drives me up the wall. She says it frequently. I'll try to argue her logic, she gets hostile. She'll try to hit me and call me disrespectful.\n\nShe's pretty violent. Majority of my family is pretty violent. My mom resorts to calling my older brother (34) or my dad over to \"beat our asses\" if we argue back with her. Unless you're me, then she'll just try to fight you 1 on 1 for no reason. Can't fight back or she'll call the cops on you or my older brother then tell all of her friends about what a shitty thing you've done trying to fight your own mother. \\*Edit because I forgot to add: She enjoys to argue with me and try to hit me when she's holding my daughter/around my daughter, then blames me for starting an argument in front of my child. Calls me an awful mother and threatens to take custody of her. Threatens to show the courts messages I've sent 2 months postpartum (messages I sent when I was dealing with PPD).\n\nAs I'm typing this, the wicked bitch of the west is trying to argue with me about a topic I know too much about (not so insane but more of a trigger for me. Drives me nuts). Would I say she has an ego? I don't know. I don't understand what goes through her mind.\n\nI've moved away from her multiple times and they were the best times away. I was stress-free (kinda.) and a bit happier. The only reason I keep coming back is the fact my daughter stays behind due to doctor appointments and I have no income out where I stay. I'm motivated enough to get a job, but my autism prevents me from talking normal enough during an interview. The managers are pretty judgy and the interview gets cut short to 5-10 mins. I don't trust keeping my daughter here. Something bad would happen.\n\nWe live in messy conditions. Always have. Before we moved from our home of 11 years, we've lived in mess. I started documenting the conditions of my mom's home last year. Planned to make a vent video and put it out to an unbiased community, but that's been put on hold because I'm unsure if it's even worth talking about. Keep being told I'm an attention seeker and I need to get over everything. I feel like I'd feel so much better if I ranted in a video and really used my voice to show emotion. Typing this out helps to an extent.\n\nIn 2014, due to these messy conditions (and some drugs), my brothers and I were taken by CPS. If it happened once, it could happen again, right? Especially if the conditions have worsened. Moving into this new apartment hasn't changed anything. It's still messy. You can try your best to keep it clean, but it'll get dirty again in 3 hours. I refuse to leave my child behind again, but I don't want to bring her into a just as messy environment as my in-laws don't know how to clean either (and they have swarms of cockroaches).\n\nSo all of this decision making is driving me up the wall and I'm getting so tired. I'm just so tired of being dealt a bad hand. My luck is garbage and it probably won't ever get better. I have my hopes up for a majority of things, but they fade slowly. I never realized how terrible my mom was until I started bringing friends over to my house. I felt like it was typical mother-teenager daughter banter everyone goes through.\n\nSince moving back in with her, she pulls this \"that's mine\" stunt with me. I'm a pretty \"selfish\" person, I suppose. I don't like to share things with people unless they ask. Most of the time, my mom will take my things and not ask. So, anytime I use \"my\", she'll pull the \"no that's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, not yours\" card. I'll ask her to move her things from my seat in the car (it's the passenger seat, but I have a habit of saying \"my\" if I'm the one using it) and she'll say \"this isn't your seat, this is MY seat\" with such hostility. She'll do it with my brother's things too. \"That's not yours, that's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_'s\" like I'm not stupid or anything. I know that's not mine. It's a habit. She tries to claim my daughter's things too, like her disability money. Tries to tell me it's not mine because she pays for everything and I don't. It's not really hers either, but I can't control my employment status.\n\nI recollect my memories often. More often lately. I've been told to not tell any teacher, therapist, etc. about things happening at home. There's been a few times I've done that and got yelled at, circa ages 6-12. Couldn't complain to family/family friends or they'd relay my thoughts to my mom and she'd complain. They'd listen, they'd agree with me, but unless I specifically begged them not to tell my mom, they'd tell her what I told them. They would agree she's being unreasonable and aggressive, yet betray my trust by telling her things I've said.\n\nMy dad is another breed of underlying trauma. He hasn't been around long. He's been in and out of prison my whole life. '01 to '03. The first time he came back, I was excited. My mom and I made a \"welcome home\" banner. The only things I could remember during the time he was out was him taking me home from the laundromat and beating me with a belt because I was complaining about wanting my shoe tied. I was 4-5 years old. He stabbed one of my older brother's friends in the neck in front of me because he thought my mom was messing around with him. I was 6-7 years old. Then he went back to prison circa 2007.\n\nHe got back out in February 2014. We talked more, I guess. Smoked weed, had fun. His mother had just died and he received all of her life insurance money. Roughly $80k. We went on a trip to San Francisco, he gave me $20 here and there, but the majority of the money went towards JDM vehicles. Don't remember much of what happened around this time. He wasn't out long. Went back to prison September 2014, shortly after my brothers and I were taken by CPS.\n\nThis last time he got out, November 2018, has been the longest he's been out in awhile. He's just stressful to be around. Doesn't talk much unless he has a blunt he wants to share. Him and my mom argue constantly. And when I say constantly, I mean she kicks him out on a weekly basis. Either he thinks she's fucking around with some guy (which she usually is) and he leaves to find the dude to beat him to death, or she thinks he's fucking around with some girl (which he usually is), they argue, and he ends up choking my mom out. This stresses me out.\n\nMy dad's demeanor is what really stresses me out and throws me off. He's comfortable enough to share his twisted thoughts to me and my mom. He's admitted that he hates my younger brothers because they're \"too weird\", too loud, and act too much like my mom. He's talked about how when he fights someone, he doesn't stop until they're dead (and he's done this once before, to my knowledge). He's talked to my mom about how he wanted to chuck rocks at geese and watch them die. He's tried to beat my husband's ass because we were arguing and he doesn't like my husband for some unknown reason. He's pretty mental. He has two personalities; a \"venom\" side and a \"real him\" side. The venom side is the aggressive, violent side. The real side is calm him.\n\nI don't know what the point was in typing all of this. I found this subreddit in trending today and I related too much to it. Triggered my anger towards my parents. I probably left out parts, I know this isn't everything. I'm too lazy to proofread, especially since I've wrote a whole essay.

They&#39;d listen, they&#39;d agree with me, but unless I specifically begged them not to tell my mom, they&#39;d tell her what I told them. They would agree she&#39;s being unreasonable and aggressive, yet betray my trust by telling her things I&#39;ve said.</p>\n\n<p>My dad is another breed of underlying trauma. He hasn&#39;t been around long. He&#39;s been in and out of prison my whole life. &#39;01 to &#39;03. The first time he came back, I was excited. My mom and I made a &quot;welcome home&quot; banner. The only things I could remember during the time he was out was him taking me home from the laundromat and beating me with a belt because I was complaining about wanting my shoe tied. I was 4-5 years old. He stabbed one of my older brother&#39;s friends in the neck in front of me because he thought my mom was messing around with him. I was 6-7 years old. Then he went back to prison circa 2007.</p>\n\n<p>He got back out in February 2014. We talked more, I guess. Smoked weed, had fun. His mother had just died and he received all of her life insurance money. Roughly $80k. We went on a trip to San Francisco, he gave me $20 here and there, but the majority of the money went towards JDM vehicles. Don&#39;t remember much of what happened around this time. He wasn&#39;t out long. Went back to prison September 2014, shortly after my brothers and I were taken by CPS.</p>\n\n<p>This last time he got out, November 2018, has been the longest he&#39;s been out in awhile. He&#39;s just stressful to be around. Doesn&#39;t talk much unless he has a blunt he wants to share. Him and my mom argue constantly. And when I say constantly, I mean she kicks him out on a weekly basis. Either he thinks she&#39;s fucking around with some guy (which she usually is) and he leaves to find the dude to beat him to death, or she thinks he&#39;s fucking around with some girl (which he usually is), they argue, and he ends up choking my mom out. This stresses me out.</p>\n\n<p>My dad&#39;s demeanor is what really stresses me out and throws me off. He&#39;s comfortable enough to share his twisted thoughts to me and my mom. He&#39;s admitted that he hates my younger brothers because they&#39;re &quot;too weird&quot;, too loud, and act too much like my mom. He&#39;s talked about how when he fights someone, he doesn&#39;t stop until they&#39;re dead (and he&#39;s done this once before, to my knowledge). He&#39;s talked to my mom about how he wanted to chuck rocks at geese and watch them die. He&#39;s tried to beat my husband&#39;s ass because we were arguing and he doesn&#39;t like my husband for some unknown reason. He&#39;s pretty mental. He has two personalities; a &quot;venom&quot; side and a &quot;real him&quot; side. The venom side is the aggressive, violent side. The real side is calm him.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what the point was in typing all of this. I found this subreddit in trending today and I related too much to it. Triggered my anger towards my parents. I probably left out parts, I know this isn&#39;t everything. I&#39;m too lazy to proofread, especially since I&#39;ve wrote a whole essay.

Last year, because my mum couldn't fill out a form he'd given her for *his* disabled parking permit because he only gave her half the information (he's mentally fully there and has no impediment to writing, he could have done it himself), he threw a strop and literally got in the car and drove *two hundred miles* to his sisters place so his brother in law could do it, then didn't come home for a week. \n\nSo I wasn't exactly inclined to accept the tenth apology, but for the sake of my mum, I did, but with the *very* clear condition that it was the last time I was going to take it from him.\n\nThat lasted all of 4 days.

I criticise them for not listening to him, his response is \"I didn't say no onion you piece of shit\", once again proving that he didn't listen to us. What's really ticking me off - I didn't even really want fish and chips, I was just gonna throw a little pizza in the microwave. If I'd gone with that, I'd have eaten 40 minutes before their food came and not even been in the room when the kebabs came.\n\nI ended up eating in my bedroom (because that's how it works - he behaves like an arsehole, I end up stuck in my room), I'm not sure if my mum ate at all. Literally the only reason I'm still here is that I legally have to be.

I&#39;ve been trying ever since that day not be anything like him.</p>\n\n<p>A month ago things started to really boil over with my brother, and I almost hit him, but I pulled back last second remembering what my dad told me. After that I started to see how I almost gave in into the idea of what my dad had for me. Since then me and my brother are better, and I see slivers on him starting to mature, which makes life on my single parent mom alot better. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like after the years have passed I&#39;ve started to see that my dad was cold, and never really showed me how to grow. His constant belittling, and yelling almost molded me into his shape, and I think I was blinded after his death to not see what type of person he was. I still love him, but I see now what type of person he was, and the type of person I never want to become.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "insaneparents", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/insaneparents/comments/gbbc2w/monthly_user_story_megathread_may_2020/fq3xcfq/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fq3xcfq", "created": 1589100165.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589071365.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/insaneparents", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gbbc2w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gbbc2w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gbbc2w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gbbc2w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqjj0n6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "AloydaAWPer", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqh6itp", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_39ow2o3p", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_3pkgv", "body": "That's a wholesome physiologist right there", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s a wholesome physiologist right there</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "insaneparents", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/insaneparents/comments/gbbc2w/monthly_user_story_megathread_may_2020/fqjj0n6/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqjj0n6", "created": 1589439428.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589410628.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/insaneparents", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqh6itp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "creeper_awwwwwmann", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589369357.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqgm61g", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4urz9ar7", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_3pkgv", "body": "Daaamn, i understand you.

However, when my parents were officially getting divorced, my mother started paying special attention to me. She would give me all sorts of stuff, all while saying that my Dad didn't care about me and that he only wanted custody to get back at her.

She misses almost all of my orchestra concerts, doesn't care about any of my honors classes, and my perfect grades in Chinese. So, fun fact, I can't handle being yelled at super well. I started crying uncontrollably. This is not a new development, and yet she yells at me to stop crying when I start because I'm \"Being manipulative\" and \"Trying to guilt her into not punishing me\".\n\nOkay, when it all starts going downhill. My orchestra takes a trip to Chicago for 4 days. Due to some weird scheduling issues, my Dad had me for two weeks before the trip. I leave my long-tailed lizard, Nevin, in my mom's care because his cage is in her home. When we get back on Sunday, she's supposed to pick me up. Two hours of texts and unanswered calls later, she never comes. I call my Dad, and he picks me up within 15 minutes. I get home and am, in my opinion, reasonably upset. She was taking a nap. She forgot she was supposed to pick me up and took a fucking nap. She yelled at me for calling my Dad instead of walking home even though it would've been a 50-minute walk down a busy road with no sidewalks, at night, in snow. When I get home, Nevin's cage is dry as hell, and guess what, he's fucking dead. He was the best thing in my life for two years, and then he was dead. This makes me so incredibly upset and I just, I can't write anymore about it.\n\nAnd then she gives her boyfriend a key to the house. I don't even have a lock on my bedroom door. And he's super creepy. He kept trying to kiss and cuddle me when she wasn't around and when I tried to tell her, she yelled at me for lying. She constantly forgets to pick me up from my Dad's place after switching weeks, she insults my looks so much. I'm too fat, I need to lose weight, I shouldn't have cut my hair, I look like a lesbian, etc. When I introduced my boyfriend to her, she yelled at me after he left about thinking I was a lesbian or something? Which for a while, I thought I was one too(I'm bi btw). I'd never introduced any of my girlfriends to her, and the only way she'd know about them would be if she looked through my phone. I told her I wanted to go to get a bachelor's in Microbiology. She screamed at me for an hour straight because I didn't want to go into nursing or teaching so I could go to her college.
