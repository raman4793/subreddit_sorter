When subs usually grow as big as ours, they decline in quality since many new users don\u2019t understand the original purpose of the subreddit and upvote unfitting posts. Eventually, that almost happened to us. At around 550k members, however, everything started to change. A new movement was started to keep posting content here that actually hurts to look at instead of edgy content and slightly cursed memes. Although there was an excessive amount of gore and porn posted here, which were swiftly taken care of, it brought a renaissance to this server, which still stands today. At nearly 700k members, the quality of suffering on here is still amazing. Less shitposts are being upvoted, and suffer worthy posts are found here more frequently. We can only say thank you to the community for letting this happen instead of becoming another clone of r/TIHI and r/NoahGetTheBoat. Keep it up guys. Keep posting suffer worthy stuff, and keep this community fresh by reporting rulebreaking and unfitting posts and we may only ask that you help us by voting up or down on the AutoModerator comment pinned to every post.
