It's difficult to know why she is reacting that way without seeing her but it's often a behaviour based in either fear or frustration. We often ask dogs to do very unnatural things such as static face-to-face greetings, which in the dog language is normally how you start a fight. Giving yourself and your dog space and encouraging her to avoid eye contact with the other dogs is an excellent way to tel the other dog that you mean them no harm and that you are just passing by. \n\nMy advice for you is to bring high value treats or toy with you during the leash walk in order to distract her when another dog approaches. Start with practicing keeping her attention with no dogs around. I like to use a combination of sit and then wait for eye contact to reward or show them the treat/toy and throw it on the ground for them to find/retrieve it. Once she is reliable with that, start introducing the sight of dogs to the exercise. Start with a lot of distance between you and the other dogs and then build up gradually closer and closer. If she starts reacting or starring at the other dog, you are too close and you need to give yourself more space by asking her to change direction with you. If she looks at another dog and then back at you with no reaction, that is the best time to give her extra reward and \"good girl\" because she chose to look at you. You will see that the more you practice this, the more she will react by looking at you, rather than pulling, lunging,  barking or being distracted by the other dog. \n\nDo not skimp on the \"good girl\". When you see any behaviour you like, you need to tell her she's a good girl. That's the only way she will know what behaviours you find good. Dogs and humans are very different ideas of what \"good\" is. Consider that in your dog's mind barking and lunging at other dogs, is not perceived as \"bad\", it's good communication to tell the other dog to leave, fight or play. \n\nAvoid pulling on the lead and making it tight as this often creates tension and stress within the dog and will make her more prone to reacting by barking and lunging. Work on having a loose \"smiling\" lead. Here is a great article on more tips to achieve loose lead:\nhttps://positively.com/dog-behavior/basic-cues/loose-leash-walking/\n\nIf you are going to take her for a run, it might be good to use the speed to keep her focused on you and speed past the dogs. Puppies, especially at 1 year old, can definitely deal with short jogs. Consider building up her endurance overtime, just like you do with human athletes and you'll be able to avoid injury. If your puppy stops, you need to allow them to rest and/or carry them and offer them water (dogs don't have the capacity to regulate their body temperature like we do). We are built for endurance running, they are built for short burst of speed hence why we make such awesome hunting partners. \n\nOver the next year, you are likely to see her become less interested in other dogs naturally. Shepparding dogs (especially if she is from a working stock) tend to become very human focused as they age. Good shepparding requires high focus so dogs with this type of high human focus traits were selected for breeding. \n\nWould you kindly pay the dog tax please?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Leash reactivity is very common. It&#39;s difficult to know why she is reacting that way without seeing her but it&#39;s often a behaviour based in either fear or frustration. We often ask dogs to do very unnatural things such as static face-to-face greetings, which in the dog language is normally how you start a fight. Giving yourself and your dog space and encouraging her to avoid eye contact with the other dogs is an excellent way to tel the other dog that you mean them no harm and that you are just passing by. </p>\n\n<p>My advice for you is to bring high value treats or toy with you during the leash walk in order to distract her when another dog approaches. Start with practicing keeping her attention with no dogs around. I like to use a combination of sit and then wait for eye contact to reward or show them the treat/toy and throw it on the ground for them to find/retrieve it. Once she is reliable with that, start introducing the sight of dogs to the exercise. Start with a lot of distance between you and the other dogs and then build up gradually closer and closer. If she starts reacting or starring at the other dog, you are too close and you need to give yourself more space by asking her to change direction with you. If she looks at another dog and then back at you with no reaction, that is the best time to give her extra reward and &quot;good girl&quot; because she chose to look at you.
