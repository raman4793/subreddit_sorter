Bad dog. Bear engages with dog. Old man charges bear. Bear, dog and man fight. Everyone survives for a while. Men in hats later kill a bear. Maybe this bear, maybe not.  \n\n\nArticle: A man and his dog were attacked and injured by a black bear Sunday on private timberland near Creswell.\u00a0(Oregon, USA)\n\nThe 72-year-old man, who was unnamed, was injured but able to escape the encounter and was treated and released from the hospital, according to a news release from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.\u00a0\n\nLater, state wildlife officials used hounds to track a bear matching the description of the one that attacked\u00a0and killed it around 5: 30 p.m. on Sunday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis was a very serious incident and the victim took the right steps by first trying to scare the bear off and then fighting back when he was attacked,\u201d said Brian Wolfer, ODFW South Willamette Watershed Manager. \u201cWe extend our well wishes to him and his family and hope for his speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nWildlife officials said the incident unfolded this way:\u00a0\n\nThe man was hiking\u00a0about 5\u00a0miles west of\u00a0Creswell near Camas Swale Road, a mix of rural residential and private timberland properties in Lane County, at.about 12:20 p.m. on Sunday.\u00a0\n\nWhile hiking a forest road, the man and his dog\u00a0encountered a bear in the road only 20 feet away, according to Oregon State Police. The dog barked and ran at the bear. The bear knocked the dog down and was on the dog when the victim approached yelling and waving his arms in an attempt to scare the bear from the dog. The bear turned from the dog and redirected toward the victim.\u00a0\n\nThe bear charged, knocking the man to the ground. The man fought back and after a short time, the bear left. The man and dog, both injured, hiked approximately 1\u00a0mile back to his residence before being transported to receive medical care.\n\nThe man suffered lacerations and punctures on his forearm as well as lacerations to his torso and head. He was released from the hospital Sunday\u00a0after receiving treatment for his wounds. His dog was treated by a veterinarian.\u00a0Both the man and his dog are expected to fully recover.\u00a0\n\nThe man described the bear as mature, black in color with a \u201ccream\u201d colored muzzle. He did not see any other bears at the scene of the attack.\n\nODFW, Oregon State Police and USDA Wildlife Services responded to the incident after Lane County Sheriff notified them yesterday. Fresh bear sign was located and Wildlife Services hounds gave a short chase before treeing a large, mature male bear with a light-colored muzzle. The bear was shot and killed at approximately 5:30 p.m.\n\nMost of the private timberlands in the area are closed to public visitors and wildlife managers will monitor for other bear activity in the area. The bear is being examined and tested for a variety of diseases including rabies, which is common practice after any incident when an animal has injured a person.\n\nThere is a very good chance that the bear that was killed is the one that injured the man, but this area is also good bear habitat and home to many bears,\u201d continued Wolfer. \u201cWhile we are not currently looking for another bear, the area will remain closed and trail cameras will be set up to see if there are other bears matching the description in the area.\u201d\n\nHuman-bear incidents are rare in Oregon. Black bear populations number between 25,000 to 30,000 statewide but there have only been four previously reported incidents in the state since 1988, none of them fatal, officials said.\u00a0", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>TLDR: Dog charges bear.

Maybe this bear, maybe not.  </p>\n\n<p>Article: A man and his dog were attacked and injured by a black bear Sunday on private timberland near Creswell.\u00a0(Oregon, USA)</p>\n\n<p>The 72-year-old man, who was unnamed, was injured but able to escape the encounter and was treated and released from the hospital, according to a news release from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Later, state wildlife officials used hounds to track a bear matching the description of the one that attacked\u00a0and killed it around 5: 30 p.m. on Sunday.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis was a very serious incident and the victim took the right steps by first trying to scare the bear off and then fighting back when he was attacked,\u201d said Brian Wolfer, ODFW South Willamette Watershed Manager. \u201cWe extend our well wishes to him and his family and hope for his speedy recovery.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wildlife officials said the incident unfolded this way:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The man was hiking\u00a0about 5\u00a0miles west of\u00a0Creswell near Camas Swale Road, a mix of rural residential and private timberland properties in Lane County, at.about 12:20 p.m. on Sunday.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>While hiking a forest road, the man and his dog\u00a0encountered a bear in the road only 20 feet away, according to Oregon State Police. The dog barked and ran at the bear. The bear knocked the dog down and was on the dog when the victim approached yelling and waving his arms in an attempt to scare the bear from the dog. The bear turned from the dog and redirected toward the victim.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The bear charged, knocking the man to the ground. The man fought back and after a short time, the bear left. The man and dog, both injured, hiked approximately 1\u00a0mile back to his residence before being transported to receive medical care.</p>\n\n<p>The man suffered lacerations and punctures on his forearm as well as lacerations to his torso and head. He was released from the hospital Sunday\u00a0after receiving treatment for his wounds. His dog was treated by a veterinarian.\u00a0Both the man and his dog are expected to fully recover.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The man described the bear as mature, black in color with a \u201ccream\u201d colored muzzle. He did not see any other bears at the scene of the attack.</p>\n\n<p>ODFW, Oregon State Police and USDA Wildlife Services responded to the incident after Lane County Sheriff notified them yesterday. Fresh bear sign was located and Wildlife Services hounds gave a short chase before treeing a large, mature male bear with a light-colored muzzle. The bear was shot and killed at approximately 5:30 p.m.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the private timberlands in the area are closed to public visitors and wildlife managers will monitor for other bear activity in the area. The bear is being examined and tested for a variety of diseases including rabies, which is common practice after any incident when an animal has injured a person.</p>\n\n<p>There is a very good chance that the bear that was killed is the one that injured the man, but this area is also good bear habitat and home to many bears,\u201d continued Wolfer. \u201cWhile we are not currently looking for another bear, the area will remain closed and trail cameras will be set up to see if there are other bears matching the description in the area.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Human-bear incidents are rare in Oregon. Black bear populations number between 25,000 to 30,000 statewide but there have only been four previously reported incidents in the state since 1988, none of them fatal, officials said.\u00a0</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "HumansAreMetal", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/HumansAreMetal/comments/gipmdo/72_year_old_dude_charges_black_bear_to_save_his/fqg0mbw/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fqg0mbw", "created": 1589364265.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1589335465.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HumansAreMetal", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
