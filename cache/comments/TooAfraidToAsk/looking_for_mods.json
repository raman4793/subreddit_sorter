Now's as good a time as ever to turn things around.\n\n**Mod experience**\n\nSome limited online mod experience, many years of IRL moderating experience. \n\nI am a teacher, so it feels like I am a mod all the time. Have taught at all levels, but most recently I taught critical media literacy to adults at a university.\n\nFor years I was the General Manager of the university's radio station. In that job, I spent a good amount of time sorting through student-submitted content for publication on our relevant platforms. I have plenty of experience reading through people's thoughts, and picking things out according to various guidelines/rules. I am familiar with the rules of this sub & feel confident that I can assess content along those guidelines.\n\nThe best job I had at the station was hosting & producing our weekly call-in advice show. It's relevant to this sub cuz it had a similar format. Students were invited to anonymously submit questions on any topic, and our team would do our best to answer their questions in good faith. Our motto was, \"if we can't answer, we'll find someone who can.\" Even if we couldn't find an exact answer to a person's question, we always made sure to leave them with *something*, even if all we could offer were more questions.\n\n\n**What is your favorite thing about this sub?**\n\nI spend a lot of time on the question subs, because answering people's questions makes me feel helpful, & that feels good. Been doing this for a few years now and I feel like I have a strong understanding of the two communities I frequent most --- TooAfraidToAsk and NoStupidQuestions.\n\nWhat I like about r/TooAfraidToAsk is its propensity to solicit deep, meaningful, often challenging, sometimes cringeworthy questions. I like that there are fewer restrictions on those questions, and people can get things off their chest a little. It has the effect of reminding me there's a person behind the screen somewhere, frustrated for answers, hoping for insight or commiseration.\n\nAnd yet, despite more relaxed submission guidelines than others (which one might assume would result in increased trolling), the community here still manages to seem *nicer* on the whole, and a little more real... more willing to delve into answers, but not tryna take shit. They don't want to go as deep as /r/needadvice, cuz they'd rather share expertise than advice... and since questions aren't as potentially shameful as on /r/myfriendwantstoknow, they don't have to coddle OPs they're being thick-minded. I feel at home here.\n\nI myself rely on these subs when I don't feel I have anyone IRL to talk to about given things, or when I wanna hear what the Internet thinks. I come to r/TooAfraidToAsk when I have something I\u2019m uncomfortable asking anyone else in my life, but would like to discuss with another human. It's dope\n\n**What is your least favorite thing about this sub?**\n\nMy least favorite thing about this sub is how often I see rushed, thoughtless or incomplete answers, right after a post is made... or worse, genuinely shitty answers, that misguide OP, or reinforce ignorant/egoistic thinking. Sometimes, if I'm not careful, these rushed answers make me rush my own answer, bc I feel like I'm competing with trolls for OPs ear. \n\nThankfully, there are good samaritans lurking in the ether, waiting to downvote and call out crappy answers, hopefully respectfully. I notice opinions flare up a little more dramatically on this sub than in NoStupidQuestions, but i think that's due to the controversial nature of questions that are scary to ask. I also know that this process comes with the territory of an open question sub, and that it's something the mod team plays a huge role in cultivating/facilitating.\n\n**What is something you would like to change about this sub, if applicable**\n\nAs a reformed r/AmITheAsshole addict, I've been itching for some kind of badge system, to identify/reward people who take time to answer questions thoroughly, in good faith, & without judgment. Maybe some kind of flair like they have on r/AskScience, where people can be labeled for their expertise in some way. \n\nRealize there are pros and cons to badge systems in general, and can imagine ways in which an incentive structure like badges could be problematic. I would be down for some editable flair tho :) \n\nI'm interested to see what would happen if mods were a little stricter about kindness in responses. I know it's not explicitly stated in the rules that people should be kind & compassionate with their answers, but perhaps it should be? Esp. on this sub, where questions can be very personal. I notice respondents grow increasingly impatient with OPs as threads progress, especially if an OP is asking with their own biases in mind. Would be interesting to see if there's a way to remind respondents to show compassion in the face of ignorance. \n\nThinking about it, user flair might help with this. If I saw someone tagged as a 'good faith' user or something, getting frustrated in a thread, I might be more inclined to help them out, & add my own positive energy. Sometimes I'll scroll by without responding, because the thread seems too contentious, and I don't want to risk getting involved with people who may just want to argue with someone. That's not why I'm here.\n\n**Do you have experience with automod / are you willing to learn a crash course in automod?**\n\nI don\u2019t really have substantive experience, so helllls yeah i would love a crash course in automod! Sounds like a dope skill to have, and I like learning new things.\n\n**hey, thanks for reading my thingy, hope wherever you are, you're happy, healthy, and safe. <3**\n\n*edit: added some additional thoughts*", "edited": 1588288995.0, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi!

Things I never thought to ask but I really want to know the answer to.</p>\n\n<h1>What is my least favorite thing about this sub?</h1>\n\n<p>All of the leading questions. </p>\n\n<p>Two examples I saw from the new tab:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/gabe0m/how_long_does_reddit_want_this_quarantine_to_go/\">Example 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/gadibl/why_are_police_officers_four_times_more_likely_to/\">Example 2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These aren&#39;t questions. This is just people soapboxing but with a question mark at the end.</p>\n\n<h1>What would I change?</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;d be more aggressive with the removal of leading questions and soapboxing. </p>\n\n<h1>Do I have experience with automod?</h1>\n\n<p>I am very experienced with automod. I recently wrote this for <a href=\"/r/swordartonline\">r/swordartonline</a>, it allows questions be flaired as such and then for the flair to be changed when the question is answered.</p>\n\n<pre><code>###############\n# Q &amp; A System\n###############\n---\n# Q and A system\n\n    type: comment\n    body (includes): [&quot;!Solved&quot;]\n    is_top_level: false\n    author:\n        is_submitter: true\n    parent_submission:\n        flair_text (includes): &quot;Question&quot;  \n        set_flair: \n            text: &quot;:answered: Answered&quot;\n            template_id: c689bb3c-8717-11ea-962f-0e68387e3623\n        overwrite_flair: true\n\n---\n# Asks if post is a question\n\n    type: submission\n    title+body (includes): [&quot;?&quot;]\n    ~flair_text (includes): &quot;Question&quot;\n    moderators_exempt: false\n    comment: |\n        **I see there is a question mark in your post, is this post a question?**\n\n        ---\n\n        If it is a question please reply &quot;!Yes&quot; to this post to mark it as a question.\n\n---\n# Marks post as a question\n\n    type: comment\n    title+body (includes): [&quot;!yes&quot;]\n    author:\n        is_submitter: true\n    parent_submission:\n        ~flair_text (includes): &quot;Question&quot;\n        set_flair: \n            text: &quot;:question: Question&quot;\n            template_id: 30bf292e-8718-11ea-b028-0e53d5068491\n        overwrite_flair: true\n    comment: |\n        **Your post has been marked as a question.**\n\n        ---\n\n        When your question has been answered please comment &quot;!Solved&quot; in response to the answer to mark it as answered.\n\n---\n# How to mark solved\n\n    type: submission\n    flair_text (includes): &quot;Question&quot;\n    moderators_exempt: false\n    comment: |\n        **I see that you marked your post as a question***\n\n        ---\n\n        When you receive the answer you were looking for please reply &quot;!Solved&quot; to it; this will mark the post as solved.
