I can't think of a single conversation topic. When I do think of something, it usually goes like this...\n\nMe: \"Oh so I assume you're doing online schooling right now due to the pandemic?\"\n\nThem: \"Yeah, my professor gives us the entire week to turn in a project. If we need help, we can video chat. It's nice tbh, I don't have to worry about fitting work and school and fun into my schedule since I don't have to be in a classroom at a specific time\"\n\nMe: \"..........Yeah that sounds nice. At least its not all bad news right now\"\n\nThem: \"Yeah its cool......\"\n\nMe: \"..........okay lemme get back to work before management whines. Talk to ya later\"\n\n\nStory - I'm a 22 year old male living in a pretty crap city (as shown by my username). I didn't really break out and talk to people until 9th grade. Since then, it seemed as if friendships just happened and were easy to come across. I'd be at work or online and just find a person that I clicked with and we'd start talking and would become close. \n\n3 years ago I met this beautiful woman at work. She had a bf but I was more than happy to step into the best friend role, as I had never clicked with someone like her. We would stay up and talk on the phone for 9 hours straight and would tell each other everything. Suffice to say, we both never felt like that with any other person and it was perfect. Tons of fun. Then it started going a little south when she cheated on her bf and her life started getting unpredictable. She started fooling around with me a little on the side. While I was ecstatic to be messing around with her, it messed with my head at the same time. It was always \"No, we're best friends and that is not changing bc I don't feel the same about you and I have a bf\" , she banged that into my head and I truly accepted that and didn't have a problem after a few talks. So when we started fooling around, I thought we might have more in the future. But she would constantly go \"Don't think this is a normal thing. I'm only doing it this one time bc blahblahblah\". Everyone could tell how much she wanted me and how good we would be together. But she didn't think so, and that's fine. But she kept confusing me about our future. \n\nEventually, I had to end it with her and she agreed that it was the right thing to do.  I lost all care for her once she stopped trying. Our relationship had a bunch of small issues that would snowball into huge issues. I tried SO hard to fix things bw us, even go back to how it was before she cheated. She couldn't get back to that point for whatever reason and started treating me like shit. It got to a point where we'd only talk if she was messaging me about her playing mind games with some random guy on the internet (We had fun joking around with random people together), but started taking it too far to try to ruin the person's life for no reason other than she enjoyed it. \n\nAll in all, 3 years of being as mentally close as 2 people can be, saying I love you nonstop, hanging out daily, planning each others lives around the other person, her following me to a brand new job, telling each other stuff that nobody else knows about, etc... I think my trust in people has been completely shattered. I know my best friend/cousin would NEVER lie about a thing to me, but nowadays I'm even forced to second think anything he says. I realized the other day that I really don't believe a word anybody tells me, even if I have no reason to believe they're lying or if I know for a fact they're telling the truth. Someone can tell me SpongeBob is yellow and my mind would sit on that thought like \"Is he really yellow...? Or are you just trying to waste my time and fuck with my head like she did?? Is it okay to trust that SpongeBob is actually yellow?!\". When I realized that, I was at work and had to sit down for a moment and I started tearing up. I've never felt this broken and lost before. Her and I ended things in January and I felt relatively fine since then. I was upset but just going through the normal stages and whatnot. Now, I don't know what to do.\n\nSo now for the reason y'all are here - Over the past 6 or 7 months (this all started before ending our relationship, when it started going downhill), I don't have a clue what to talk about with people. I can't find a single conversation topic that I haven't already discussed 50 times with somebody else. I'll sit there at work and see everybody getting along and 2 people talking the entire 12 hour shift, enjoying every minute of their convo. I can't even remember what its like to talk to somebody without freaking out in my head wondering \"What do I say?! I don't want this person to think I'm a creep! I don't want to come off as a boring isolated person who's never talked to a person in his life. This used to be easy, but what do I do right now?!\"\n\nI'm 100% confident that my issues stem from how our relationship ended and how I can't trust people right now. But I want to trust people.
