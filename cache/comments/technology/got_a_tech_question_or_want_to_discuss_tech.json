To be clear, the only part that gets hot are the heatsinks, everything else (the phone, the wood surface) just gets lukewarm at best.  </p>\n\n<p>As far as temps go I estimate the heatsinks hit about 65*c / 150*f, the point where I cannot comfortably touch them for more than 3 seconds or so. I know the ignition point of particleboard, wood, MDF, etc. is miles above that, but those temps still really concern me.
